# shell49

Remote MicroPython shell based on Dave Hylands' [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell).

## Main features:

* Connect to one or more microcontrollers with MicroPython over a wired connection or wirelessly,
* Flash firmware to the microcontroller (`flash`),
* Copy files from the host to the microcontroller (`cp`, `rsync`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `cd`, `rm`),
* Send files from the host to the microcontroller for execution (`run`),
* Open a `REPL` console on the microcontroller (`repl`)


## Installation

`shell49` is written in pure Python and requires Python interpreter version 3.4 or later. Install from the console with

```
pip install shell49
```

If the installation fails, this may be due to the lack of an appropriate `C/C++` compiler that is required to install some of the library modules used by `shell49` (in particular `netifaces`, needed for mDNS).  Follow the instructions below to install a compiler:

* OS X: from the app store, install `xcode`, the official [Apple Developer Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* Windows: follow the instructions at [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235639.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235639.aspx). You will be asked to download and install the `Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools 2015`.

## Upgrading

To upgrade shell49 to the newest version, issue the command

```
pip install shell49 --upgrade
```

## Help

At the command prompt, type

```
shell49 -h
```

to get a list of command line options.

For information about available commands, start `shell49` and type

```
help
```

## Common Tasks

* [Flash MicroPython firmware](doc/flash.md)
* [Connect to MicroPython board](doc/connect.md)
* REPL console - type `repl` at the `shell49` prompt
* [Run program stored in file on host](doc/run.md)
* Copy files to/from MicroPython board. See `help` for `cp`, `rsync`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `cd`, `rm`.

## Caveats

Beware of the different prompts:

1. Operating system (terminal program) prompt: E.g. `$` (depends on operating system)
2. `shell49` prompt: `>`
3. Repl prompt (invoked at `>` prompt in `shell49` with `repl`): `>>>`

On some systems `shell49` uses different colors as further indication of the mode it is in.
