Description: # frsystem v1.1.2
        
        ## FaceRecognitionSystem class
        
        Initializes a **FaceRecognitionSystem** class object.  
        
        1. Calls MTCNN face detection model object.
        2. Calls FaceNet or VGGFace model to extract embeddings (features) from face images.
        
         3.  Creates a connection to the database of known faces by calling the "Database" class object. 
        
        - self.db is the dictionary of known faces with id : name key-value pairs.
        - self.embeddings is the dictionary of known faces with id : embeddings key-value pairs.
        
         4. Loads face classifier that was trained on the database of known faces. 
        
        ```python
        frsystem.frs.FaceRecognitionSystem(self,
        				   embedding_model=None,
        				   weights=None,
        				   face_classifier=None,
        				   **kwargs)
        ```
        
        ### Arguments
        Name | Description 
        ---------- | ---------- |
        embedding_model	| Options: <br>  1. **None**. If you want to use only face location and facial features detection functionality.<br> 2. **facenet**. Use FaceNet as the feature extractor model. Input size for FaceNet is 160x160x3 <br> 3. **vggface**. Use VGG-Face as the feature extractor model. Input size for VGG-Face is 224x224x3
        weights	| File path to the weights for the chosen embedding model. Defaults to None
        face_classifier	| File path to pre-trained face classifier. Face classifier 
        **kwargs | Two keyword arguments that are passed to the Database class. **db_file** and **embeddings_file**
