Type annotations for
[boto3.WAFV2 1.14.51](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.14.51/reference/services/wafv2.html#WAFV2) service
compatible with [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and other tools.

Generated by [mypy-boto3-buider 2.2.0](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3_builder).

More information can be found on [boto3-stubs](https://pypi.org/project/boto3-stubs/) page.

## How to install

Make sure you have [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) installed and activated in your IDE.

Install `boto3-stubs` for `WAFV2` service.

```bash
python -m pip install boto3-stubs[wafv2]
```

## How to use

### Client annotations

`WAFV2Client` provides annotations for `boto3.client("wafv2")`.

```python
import boto3

from mypy_boto3_wafv2 import WAFV2Client
from mypy_boto3_wafv2.type_defs import AndStatementTypeDef, ...

client: WAFV2Client = boto3.client("wafv2")

# now client usage is checked by mypy and IDE should provide code auto-complete

# works for session as well
session = boto3.session.Session(region="us-west-1")
session_client: WAFV2Client = session.client("wafv2")
```








### Typed dictionations

`mypy_boto3_wafv2.type_defs` module contains structures and shapes assembled
to typed dictionaries for additional type checking.

```python

def get_structure() -> AndStatementTypeDef:
    return {
      ...
    }
```


## Dynamic type annotations

`mypy_boto3` command generates `boto3.client/resource` type annotations for
`mypy_boto3_wafv2` and other installed services.

```bash
# Run this command after you add or remove service packages
python -m mypy_boto3
```

Generated type annotations provide overloads for `boto3.client` and `boto3.resource`,
`boto3.Session.client` and `boto3.Session.resource` functions,
so explicit type annotations are not needed.

- `mypy` supports function overloads as expected
- `PyCharm` also supports function overloads, but consumes a lot of RAM, use carefully if you have many services installed
- `VSCode` does not currently support function overloads, use explicit type annotations

```python

# Type is discovered correctly by mypy and PyCharm
# VSCode still needs explicit type annotations
client = boto3.client("wafv2")

session_client = boto3.Session().client("wafv2")
```
