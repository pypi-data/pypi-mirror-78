0.1.0b4 (2019-11-22)
====================


Features
--------

- Make repositories "typed". Repositories now live at a detail endpoint, i.e.
  ``/pulp/api/v3/repositories/cookbook/cookbook/``. Sync is performed by POSTing
  to ``{repo_href}/sync/ remote={remote_href}`` instead of POSTing to the
  ``{remote_href}/sync/ repository={repo_href}`` endpoint. Creating a new
  repository version (adding & removing content) is performed by POSTing to
  ``{repo_href}/modify/``
  `#65 <https://github.com/gmbnomis/pulp_cookbook/issues/65>`_
- Add validation to repository versions: A repository version must not have
  entries with duplicate repo_keys. Remove the current check done at publication
  time.
  `#68 <https://github.com/gmbnomis/pulp_cookbook/issues/68>`_


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Sync is no longer available at the ``{remote_href}/sync/ repository={repo_href}`` endpoint.
