# soccerplots

* **soccerplots** is a Python package that can be used for making visualizations for football analytics.

* The main aim of `soccerplots` is to save time for analysts so they can focus more on the analysis rather than coding the visualizations from scratch.

* If you have any problem or confusion regarding how to use it ping me [here](https://twitter.com/slothfulwave612).
