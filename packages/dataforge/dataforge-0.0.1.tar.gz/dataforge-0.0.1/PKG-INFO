        Data Forge
        ==========
        
        .. note:: Tested with Python 3.7.
        
        Data forge is a Python package containing tools for creating and packaging
        data products.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation in a virtual environment of the type created by the
        `venv module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ or
        `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ is highly recommended.
        
        To install::
            
            pip install --install-option="--with-openssl" --install-option="--openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl" pycurl
            pip install --editable .

        REDCap
        ======
        
        Management of API Tokens
        ------------------------
        
        To access a REDCap project via the API, you will need to obtain a REDCap API
        token. To avoid having to enter the token each time you export data, it is
        convenient to add the token to your system keyring. You may do this with the
        following command::
        
            keyring set <redcap_hostname> [<project_name>]
        
        where ``<redcap_hostname>`` is the hostname of your REDCap server (e.g.,
        ``redcap.uchicago.edu``) and ``<project_name>`` is an abbreviated (no spaces)
        name of the REDCap project (e.g., ``MyREDCapProject``). Although specifying a
        project name is not required, doing so will allow you to store API tokens for
        multiple projects. When you are asked to enter a password, enter the API token
        you obtained for your project.
        
        .. warning:: Do not store your API token in a plaintext or otherwise
                     unencrypted file, and do not write it down on a piece of paper.
                     If another person were to obtain your API token, he or she would
                     have the same access to your REDCap project as you do. If there
                     is ever a possibility that your token has been compromised, you
                     should immediately regenerate your token.
        
        SSL/TLS Certificate Chain
        -------------------------
        
        If ``pycurl`` is reporting certificate problems when using the
        ``redcap_export`` command, then you may have to supply a different certificate
        chain.  For example, at the moment https://redcap.uchicago.edu/
        has a certificate chain containing an expired certificate; although this will
        work with modern web browsers, it fails with OpenSSL 1.0.x. See the following
        links for more information:
        
        - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62107431/curl-error-60-ssl-certificate-problem-certificate-has-expired
        - https://whatsmychaincert.com
        
        In particular, the second link will permit you to download a chain without the
        expired certificate.
