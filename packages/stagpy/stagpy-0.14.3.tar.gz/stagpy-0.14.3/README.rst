StagPy
======

StagPy is a command line tool to process the output files of your StagYY
simulations and produce high-quality figures.

This command line tool is built around a generic interface that allows you to
access StagYY output data directly in a Python script.

You can install StagPy with ``pip`` from the `Python Package Index`__.

See `the complete documentation`__ for more information on the installation and
explanations on how to use StagPy.
