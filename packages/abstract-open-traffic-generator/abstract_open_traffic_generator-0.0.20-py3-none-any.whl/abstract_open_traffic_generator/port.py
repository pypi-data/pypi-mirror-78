    - name (str): Unique name of an object that is the primary key for objects found in arrays
    - location (str): The location of a test port
        It is the endpoint where packets will emit from
        Test port locations can be the following:
        physical appliance with multiple ports
        physical chassis with multiple cards and ports
        local interface
        virtual machine, docker container, kubernetes cluster The test port location format is implementation specific
        Use the /results API to determine what formats the implementation supports for the location property
    - link_state (Union[up, down]): The configured link state of the port
        Compare the actual state vs the configured state by using the /results API
    - capture_state (Union[start, stop]): The configured capture state of the port
        Compare the actual state vs the configured state by using the /results API
