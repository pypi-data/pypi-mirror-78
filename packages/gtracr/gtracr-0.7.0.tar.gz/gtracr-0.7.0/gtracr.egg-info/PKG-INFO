Description: # gtracr - A **G**PU-accelerated **Tra**cking simulation for **C**osmic **R**ays
        
        **gtracr** is a 3-D simulation package that simulates the trajectories of cosmic rays that arrive at a certain location on any location around the globe :earth_americas: . The package uses the [IGRF (International Geomagnetic Reference Field) model](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html) as the Earth's magnetic field and simulate trajectories using a 4th-order Runge Kutta numerical integration method.
        
        The main components as well as the user interface of the package is written in Python, so using this package is straighforward with minimal steps for evaluation of a trajectory. The core of the package (that is, the evaluation of the geomagnetic field and the numerical integration) is written in C++, however, and as such each trajectory is optimized to perform evaluations at around 1 ms :watch:. 
        
        The code can further produce geomagnetic cutoff rigidities that either validates or invalidates a cosmic ray based on its trajectory, which is a key feature necessary to distinguish between allowed and forbidden trajectories.
        
        *Note*: The current version does ***not*** support GPU parallelization. This will be done in future versions, check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG) for more details.
