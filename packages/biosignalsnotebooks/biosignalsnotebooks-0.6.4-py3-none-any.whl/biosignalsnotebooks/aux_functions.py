"""
Includes a set of auxiliary functions that are invoked in other biosignalsnotebooks modules.

Like the module name suggests, these functions have a supporting role and their use is not
restricted to a single module or category of biosignalsnotebooks Jupyter Notebooks.

Considering this generic nature, the great majority of the functions contained inside
"aux_functions" module are classified as private and his inclusion in the package is only intended
for the use inside biosignalsnotebooks project, though they are completely functional for other
applications.

def _is_instance(type_to_check, element, condition="any", deep=False):

    -----
    Brief
    -----
    Function that verifies when "all" or "any" elements of the list "element" have the type
    specified in "type_to_check" input.

    -----------
    Description
    -----------
    In some biosignalsnotebooks functions their implementation is extremely dependent on a specific
    criterion, i.e., 'all' list entries should be of a specific data type.

    In order to ensure this functionality _is_instance function was implemented.

    For example, when plotting data through 'plot' function of 'visualise' module, 'all' entries
    of time axis and data samples lists need to be 'Numeric'.
    In order to this condition be checked _is_instance should be called with the following input
    values:

    _is_instance(Number, [1, 2, 3, True, ...], 'all')

    Sometimes is also relevant to check if at least one of list entries belongs to a data type, for
    cases like this, the argument "condition" should have value equal to "any".

    --------
    Examples
    --------
    >>> _is_instance(Number, [1, 2, 3, True], 'all')
    False
    >>> _is_instance(Number, [1, 1.2, 3, 5], 'all')
    True

    ----------
    Parameters
    ----------
    type_to_check : type element
        Data type (all or any elements of 'element' list must be of the type specified in the
        current input).

    element : list
        List where condition specified in "condition" will be checked.

    condition : str
        String with values "any" or "all" verifying when "any" or "all" element entries have the
        specified type.

    deep : bool
        Flag that identifies when element is in a matrix format and each of its elements should be
        verified iteratively.

    Returns
    -------
    out : boolean
        Returns True when the "condition" is verified for the entries of "element" list.

def _butter_bandpass_filter(signal, low_cutoff, high_cutoff, sample_rate, order=6):
    """
    -----
    Brief
    -----
    Function with the purpose of applying a digital bandpass filter on signal, in order to attenuate
    the signal content outside the frequency band [low_cutoff, high_cutoff].

    -----------
    Description
    -----------
    In signal processing, knowledge can be extracted from different domains, the most common is the
    time-domain, where statistical parameters are taken by analysing the acquired samples of
    a time series.

    Another common domain of signal analysis is the frequency domain, also known as
    "Fourier Domain" due to the fact that for converting data from time to frequency domain it is
    necessary to apply the Fourier Transform.

    The basic principle behind the Fourier Analysis is related with the mathematical decomposition
    of a time-series.

    As demonstrated by Joseph Fourier in his book "TheÃÅorie analytique de la chaleur":
    "some functions could be written as an infinite sum of harmonics".

    Each "harmonic" is characterized by a specific frequency, so, after decomposing a time series
    into their harmonics/elementary components, the "frequency content" of the signal is revealed.

    If the frequency content is manipulated, for example, by decreasing the weight of some
    harmonics, after the reconstruction ("sum of harmonics") then the resultant signal in time
    domain will be slightly different comparing with the original one.

    With the current function an input "signal" is applied to a butterworth bandpass filter, in
    order to decrease the weight of elementary components with frequencies smaller than "low_cutoff"
    or bigger than "high_cutoff".

    Filter order can also be specified (the bigger the order more quickly the response of the filter
    will be, near the cutoff frequencies). Higher orders could cause a less stable behavior of the
    system.

    ----------
    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : ndarray
        Array that contains the acquired samples of the signal under analysis.
    low_cutoff : int
        Low cutoff frequency of the bandpass filter.
    high_cutoff : int
        High cutoff frequency of the bandpass filter.
    sample_rate : int
        Sampling rate at which the acquisition took place.
    order : int
        Filter order.

    Returns
    -------
    out : list
        Filtered signal samples.

def _moving_average(data, wind_size=3):
    """
    -----
    Brief
    -----
    Application of a moving average filter for signal smoothing.

    -----------
    Description
    -----------
    In certain situations it will be interesting to simplify a signal, particularly in cases where
    some events with a random nature take place (the random nature of EMG activation periods is
    a good example).

    One possible simplification procedure consists in smoothing the signal in order to obtain
    only an "envelope". With this methodology the analysis is mainly centered on seeing patterns
    in data and excluding noise or rapid events [1].

    The simplification can be achieved by segmenting the time series in multiple windows and
    from each window an average value of all the samples that it contains will be determined
    (dividing the sum of all sample values by the window size).

    A quick and efficient implementation (chosen in biosignalsnotebooks package) of the moving window
    methodology is through a cumulative sum array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : list
        List of signal samples.
    wind_size : int
        Number of samples inside the moving average window (a bigger value implies a smoother
        output signal).

    -----
    Brief
    -----
    Function for filtering kwargs, ensuring that invalid keywords are not passed as arguments.

    -----------
    Description
    -----------
    Many Python functions included in the major packages, include in their definition some
    keyword arguments (kwargs), i.e., a dictionary having as keys non-formal parameters.

    In spite of not being formally defined, only certain keywords are accepted.

    In order to avoid that the biosignalsnotebooks user gets some errors due to an invalid keyword
    argument, when invoking functions such as 'plot' ('visualise' module), _filter_keywords receives
    the keywords entered by the user, checks if these keywords are valid and only returns a
    dictionary with the valid ones.

    ----------
    Parameters
    ----------

        Function where the **kwargs dictionary must be applied.
