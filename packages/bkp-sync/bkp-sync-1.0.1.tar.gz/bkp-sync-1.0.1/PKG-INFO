Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This set of utilities is my own home grown attept to enable a local or offsite backup that runs automatically and backs up changed files over time. It has grown to include syncrhonization as well allowing a set of directories to be synced with a target server.
        
        Initially it was developed to work with the Amazon S3 storage service that is part of the Amazon Web Servvices platform, but then was expanded to allow for using sftp and local file systems.
        
        When using the public cloud, the tools rely on the s3cmd tool and pgp encryption both of which need to be installed and set up. When using ssh they rely on the python package paramiko which is an all python implementation of ssh/sftp.
        
        The unit of transfer in all cases is whole files and no attempt is made to handle collisions in the sync case. Local deletion on one of the clients is supported, i.e. files deleted on the client won't come back but they are not deleted on the server if they have been synced.
        
        The backup creates a unique directory structure per backup and new copies of changed files are copied there. This creates a history of changes to files and the restore utility is capable of restoring previous versions of files as of a given date.
        
        The sync utility keeps a set of directories in sync based on the modification dates of the files.
        
        Typically to start using one of these utilies you create the config file and then run the utility in --dryrun --verbose mode which will output all of the actions it "would" perform to the standard error output.
        
        It is recommended that you capture this output and review it to make sure the actions are sensible and tune the configuration with multiple dryruns until it is working well.
        
        Then since the first backup or sync is usually the largest it is suggestd to run a non dryrun with the verbose output to monitor progress and let that run to completion.
        
        After this initial run then bkp or sync can be added to a scheduler like cron and the incremental work will happend in the background.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can just check out this repo and put the scripts directory on your path... and the top level directory on your PYTHONPATH or...
        
        Assuming you have Python 3 (>= version 3.6.9) installed and pip:
            python3 -m pip install bkp-sync
        
        Note: this will add the scripts to your ~/.local/bin, you may need to add this to your path...
        
        Backup
        ======
        
            Usage: bkp [options]
        
            A backup script for backing up files to {s3,file, or sftp}, configuration in
            ~/.bkp/bkp_config
        
            Options:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -c, --configure       Prompt to create initial ~/.bkp/bkp_config
              -v, --verbose         Log all activity to console
              -d, --dryrun          Do everything except actually perform actions
              -f CONFIG_FILE, --file=CONFIG_FILE
                                     Load config from this file default is
                                     ~/.bkp/bkp_config
              -r RESTART_FILE, --restart=RESTART_FILE
                                    Restart backup from this backup log file
              -K, --compact         Clean out empty backup directories
              -l, --list            list the files backed up for this machine and dates
                                    available
        
            Template of config
        
            bucket = ssh://server-name:port/home/user/BkpVolume
            dirs =  /home/james
            exclude_files =  .*\.deb$|.*\.pyc$|.*\.so$|.*\.o$|.*\.la$|.*\.a$|.*\.[1-9]$|.*\.class$|.*\.jar$|.*\.war$
            exclude_dirs =  james/base;james/copier;james/data;james/fax;james/foscam;hplip\-3.12.6;james/installer;james/io;james/ip;james/old_boost;james/plugins;james/ppd;james/prnt;james/scan;james/subsonic;james/ui;james/ui4;james/zoneminder;james/doc;james/Downloads
            log_email =  backup@email-domain.com
            error_email =  user@email-domain.com
            threads =  5
            smtp_server =  smtp.email-domain.com
            smtp_username =  backup@email-domain.com
            smtp_password =  backup-password
            ssh_username = ssh_user
            ssh_password = ssh_pass
            end_config = True
        
        bkp defaults to reading it's config from ~/.bkp/bkp_config this can be overidden using the -f/--file option and this file can be created using the -c/--configure option which will prompt for the items in the config.
        
        In bkp_config the properties have the following meaning:
        
            bucket = The target root directory in remote storage where backups will be stored it should have the form {ssh://|file://|s3://}{server-name:port|path|bucket}{path}
            dirs = A semicolon delimited list of local directories to be backed up these should be fully qualified paths, all subdirectories of these paths will be processed
            exclude_files = This is a Python regular expression (see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) which if it matches a file name will cause it to be excluded
            exclude_dirs = This is a list of Python regular expressions separated by semi-colons (;) which if they match any path will cause that path to be exlcuded
            log_email = Every successful backup will e-mail the backup log to this e-mail address
            error_email = Every failed backup will e-mail the exception to this e-mail address
            threads = Number of file transfer threads to use to process copies, recommended 5 for sftp and 10 for other targets
            ssh_username = Name of the user to log in to ssh with
            ssh_password = Password of the user to log in to ssh with
        
        bkp Options
        
        Most of the options are self explanatory some more information is as below.
        
            -r RESTART_FILE, --restart=RESTART_FILE When a backup for a given time range fails it writes a log of the completed work and restart information to ~/.bkp/bkp.{date}.log.
            This file can be used to restart that backup using this command once the problem that caused the failure is resolved. The bkp process will also send e-mail if it finds a restart file or files on the machine.
        
            -K, --compact bkp will create empty backups sometimes, to speed up other processing running this once a week or so will clean up those empty directories.
        
        
        Restore
        =======
        
            Usage: rstr [options] restore_pattern { list of restore patterns }
        
            A restore script for restoring files backed up to {ssh,file, or s3} using bkp. A restore
            pattern is a python regular expression matching a path to restore ex:
            /home/james/My.*/.*\.jpg$
        
            Options:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -a ASOF, --asof=ASOF  date time to restore back to in YYYY.MM.DD.HH.MM.SS
                                    format. Default is now.
              -v, --verbose         Log all activity to console
              -d, --dryrun          Do everything except actually perform actions
              -f CONFIG_FILE, --file=CONFIG_FILE
                                    Load config from this file default is
                                    ~/.bkp/bkp_config
              -m MACHINE, --machine=MACHINE
                                    Machine name to restore for. Default is this machine.
              -p RESTORE_PATH, --path=RESTORE_PATH
                                    Alternate existing target directory use as root for
                                    restore. Default is the root directory of backed up
                                    file.
              -e EXCLUDE, --exclude=EXCLUDE
                                    Pattern on ENTIRE target path to exclude files from
                                    restore. Use multiple args to add multiple filters.
        
            Restore refers to the same config file in ~/.bkp/bkp_config as bkp.
        
        rstr Options
        
        Most of the options are self expanatory, more information below.
        
            -m MACHINE, --machine=MACHINE If you are restoring onto a machine whose machine name is different this is the source machine's name.
            This is the name returned by python's platform.node() method and the linux hostname command.
        
            -p RESTORE_PATH, --path=RESTORE_PATH If you are restoring to a different directory than the original backup path, then this is the new root path.
            All target paths will be created as subdirectories of this path.
        
        Sync
        ====
        
            Usage: sync [options]
        
            A synchronization script for synchronizing local and remote directories in {sftp, or file}, configuration in
            ~/.sync/sync_config
        
            Options:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -c, --configure       Prompt to create initial ~/.sync/sync_config
              -v, --verbose         Log all activity to console
              -d, --dryrun          Do everything except actually perform actions
              -f CONFIG_FILE, --file=CONFIG_FILE
                                    Load config from this file default is
                                    ~/.sync/sync_config
        
        Sync compares the a list of local directories on the local machine with their counterparts on the remote machine and if they are newer it puts them to the remote machine, if they are older it gets them from the remote machine, and if there are files on the remote machine that don't exist it will get them.
        These actions are subject to the exlude_files and exclude_dirs filters in the configuration.
        Any files deleted on the client machine (the one running sync) will not be synced in the future, but they will not be removed from the remote machine.
        
        Sync config template:
        
            target = ssh://server-name:port
            dirs =  /home/user
            exclude_files =
            exclude_dirs = ^/home/user/(?!Documents[/]?).*
            threads =  5
            ssh_username =  ssh_user
            ssh_password =  ssh_pass
            end_config = True
        
        Example crontab
        ===============
        
            # Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
            #
            # Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
            # indicating with different fields when the task will be run
            # and what command to run for the task
            #
            # To define the time you can provide concrete values for
            # minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
            # and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
            # Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
            # daemon's notion of time and timezones.
            #
            # Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
            # email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
            #
            # For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
            # at 5 a.m every week with:
            # 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
            #
            # For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
            #
            # m h  dom mon dow   command

        Contributing
        ============
        
        If you're interested in contributing these are the instructions. Please understand that while you retain the copyright for any of your work, once it is contributed it is licensed under the same MIT license as the rest of the project.
        
        To get set up you should do the following:
        
          *   Create your own fork of the repository on github [https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/]
          *   Clone this repo to your local machine ( see same directions )
          *   Make changes and test them, the regression tests run with the runtests script need to pass
          *   Sometimes you may need to add new tests if your functionality isn't covered in the existing tests
          *   Please update this README or send us a request to udpate the wiki with documentation
          *   Create and send a pull request upstream and we'll review the change and decide if it should go in, we may have changes or additions before we accept it. Not every change will be accepted, but you are free to use your change from your own fork.
        
        Some of the finer details of the dev environment:
        
          *   You need Python 3.6.9 ( or better I've tested up to 3.8)  available on your machine
          *   I'd recommend creating a local python environment using venv something like:
            *    python3 -m pip install venv
            *    in your checkout directory: python3 -m venv .
               *    when you start working in the directory: source bin/activate
                  *    first time do: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
                  *    and: python3 -m pip install -r dev\_requirements.txt
            *    ./runtests will run the tests you can select individual tests using -k see the pytest documentation for other useful options
          *   make sure that when you're running your changes that PYTHONPATH is set to your checkout directory
          *   there are some environment variables required by the tests:
            *    SSH\_USERNAME = username for a test ssh/sftp server
            *    SSH\_PASSWORD = password for a test ssh/sftp server
            *    SSH\_BASEPATH = target folder expressed as ssh://host:port/directory/subdirectory, you should be comfortable with anything below this path being deleted
            *    S3\_BUCKET = a reference to an AWS S3 bucket to write to, you should be comfortable with everything in this bucket being deleted, should be of the form: s3://bucketname
            *    FILE\_BASEPATH = a reference to a file system path for testing, you should be comfortable with anything below this path being deleted, form is a fully qualified path
            *    S3\_CONFIG = fully qualified path and filename for your s3cmd config file
            *    TEST\_EMAIL = an e-mail address that tests will send result and error e-mails to
          *   You'll need to configure s3cmd with the credentials for AWS s3
        
        If you happen to use Microsoft Visual Studio Code here is a template for launching and debugging both tests and the code, put this in launch.json for your working folder:
