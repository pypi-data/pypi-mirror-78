## Install

Python 3.6 or newer is required.

Ballparker is in PyPI, so you can install the latest released version as follows:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user ballparker
```

If you want the latest source tree, instead of latest release, you can install
directly from the main Git repo as follows:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user git+https://gitlab.com/ryanpavlik/ballparker.git
```

Alternately, especially if you would like to participate in development, you can
install from a clone of this repository. It's recommended to install this in a
virtualenv *especially* if you choose this install option. Something like this
will work on *nix-like systems, adjusted for your shell usage.

```bash
# Create a virtualenv in `venv`
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
. venv/bin/activate

# Install a link to this package in the venv.
python3 -m pip install --editable .
```

If you follow those instructions, the virtualenv will refer to the source
instead of copying the source, so updating your local clone of this repo will
also update the virtualenv. Omit the `--editable` if you want other behavior.

## Usage

You will typically create a new Python file for each estimate you produce. You
can start it with the template in
[`ballpark_template.py`](ballpark_template.py).

See the documentation for `ballparker.dsl` for instructions on the ballpark
process this package was designed around.

When preparing for a customer, do not forget to add project-managment overhead
to the estimated days!
