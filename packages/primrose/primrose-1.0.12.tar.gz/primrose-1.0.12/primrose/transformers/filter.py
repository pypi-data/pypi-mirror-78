        The filters can operate on a single column with a fixed set of operations and a static value:

        fixed operations: `==`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`

        The feature_filters object should be structured as a list of lists:

        feature_filters: `[[column, operation, static value], [column, operation, static value]]`

        example: `[["number_of_members", "<", 1000]]` for filtering all rows with number_of_members less than 1000

            data (dict): dictionary with dataframes from all readers
