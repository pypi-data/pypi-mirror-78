        Normaly any storage can use the default IFSFile implementation but it's
        also posssible that a special IFSStorage requires a special IFSFile
        implementation. Or as a more common usecase it's possible to inherit
        from FSFile and use such content types as a fsFileFactory.

        If a storage uses different fsFileFactory types, you can use an explicit
        fsFileFactory as argument in the store method.

        An important part is the storageName value. The storageName get set
        to the returned IFSFile instance after the object is created. This
        allows us to bind an IFSFile to it's relevant storage utility. Note,
        an IFSStorage utility uses registration names which isn't an 1:1
        relation to the used stroageName. A storageName is allways the same even
        if you register the utility more then once within different names.

        The default storageName is an empty string which will fit for unnamed
        utility registration.

        I recommend to use explicit fsFileFactory classes for store different
        content types in one IFSStorage utility and not to create different
        storages with different storageName values for the same storage backend.
        But that's up to you. Just keep in mind the storageName is the used
        IFSStorage utilit name which get used after IFSFile creation. Which
        means the utility must get registered with the used storageName. But
        the storage can also get registered within another additional name.
        Anyway, this is just a side effect because there is no way to get
        an utility name if we lookup an utility because the registry returns
        the utility by it's registry name which the utility itself doesn't know.
