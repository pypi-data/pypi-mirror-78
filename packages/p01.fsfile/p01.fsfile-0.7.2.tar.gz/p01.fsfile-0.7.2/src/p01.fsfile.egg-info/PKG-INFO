        0.7.2 (2020-09-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix: Fix fsID and use the correct os separator. After migrate a system
          windows to linux the fsID contains windows separator and this fails for
          build the correct file storage path. We check if the fsID contains windows
          separator and if on a non windows system, we replace the os path separator
          with forward slash.
        
        
        0.7.1 (2013-08-28)
        ------------------
        
        - fix ``removeGhostFiles``: remove the ghostFile from ``_ghostFiles`` also
          if it does not exist. No need to keep the reference around.
        
        - added ``timeLimit`` to ``removeGhostFiles``, useful for automated cleanup
        
        
        0.7.0 (2012-11-16)
        ------------------
        
        - fix typos and pyflakes warnings
        
        - remove storage base path from fsID. Storing the full path just causes problems.
          Added IFSFile.path which has the full path then.
          That causes some API changes.
          And make sure you provide the right utility with the right name.
          (utility name == IFSStorage.storageName)
          Generation REQUIRED!
        
        - renamed private methods to start with `_`
        
        
        0.6.0 (2011-01-04)
        ------------------
        
        - changed p01.fsfile config argument fsStorage to storage since camel
          case seems to be broken. Also note that the WSGI to product config chain
          seems to be broken too. This means you have to apply the WSGI arguments to
          the zope product config after the WSGI application factory will setup the
          product config otherwise previsous applied product config get overwritten.
          Even better use a real product config directive in your zope.conf file and
          prevent all this problems.
        
        - move transaction support from IFSStorage to IFSStorageTransationSupport
          interface. This let us implement storages with a different transaction
          support concept. Inherited all other storage interfaces from
          IFSStorageTransationSupport for BBB.
        
        - improve IConnection lokup, implement base implementation which could be used
          for non peristent storages. Also implement lookup for persistent storages
          classes.
        
        - move persistent and contained from the base class to the core implementation.
          This allows us to use the base classes for non persistent utilities.
        
        - added ghost file support classes based on local utility lookup. This allows
          to use a global non persistent storage setup with a local ghost file utility.
        
        
        0.5.0 (2009-05-12)
