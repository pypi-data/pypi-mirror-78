Description: # iot.io Client
        ### iot.io Overview
        This project aims to create a lightweight and intuitive system for connecting
        IoT devices to a central server for small IoT system implementations and hobbyists.
        
        The framework focuses on providing easy to use system of libraries so the end user does
        not need to understand the protocol implementation, though this also is fairly simple.
        
        The format of the framework is somewhat reminiscent of [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) 
        where handlers functions are defined and executed and run as events are triggered.
        
        
        ### Quickstart Guide (Client)
        This is an example of a simple IoTClient instance which connects to a server accepting
        "echo" clients ping the server every 5 seconds with a message and print the server's response.
        
        ```python
        from iotio_client import IoTClient
        import asyncio
        import logging
        
        
        # create an instance of our client
        client = IoTClient("test_client", "echo", {}, logging_level=logging.DEBUG)
        
        
        # define a handler for the server's response
        @client.on("message")
        async def test(message):
            print(message)
        
        
        # define a coroutine for pinging the server at a 5 second interval
        async def ping():
            # wait until the client is ready before sending a message
            await client.wait_until_ready()
        
            while True:
                await client.send("message", "hello")
                await asyncio.sleep(5)
        
        
        # initialize the client and ping coroutine
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            # run the coroutine
            client.loop.create_task(ping())
        
            # run the client
            client.run("localhost:5000")
        ```
