Sensor for use in the XRootD ``cms.perf`` directive.
Measures system load, as well as cpu, memory, and network utilization,
to enable load-balancing in a cluster of multiple XRootD servers.

With its support for individual re-configuration of each sensor reading,
``cms_perf`` allows to fine-tune or even re-define load reporting to your needs.
No need to hack any scripts, just install, configure, run.

Installation and Usage

The sensor can be installed using ``pip``,
then configured using the ``cms.perf`` directive.
See the `documentation`_ for details and examples.
