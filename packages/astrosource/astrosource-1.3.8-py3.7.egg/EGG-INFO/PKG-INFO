Description: # astrosource
        Analysis script for sources with variability in their brightness. The package was formerly called `autovar` but this clashes with an existing Python package.
        
        ## Installation
        
        It is strongly recommended you use python 3 and a virtual environment
        
        Using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python:
        
        ```bash
        conda create -n astrosource python=3
        source activate astrosource
        ```
        
        The package is available on PyPi and can be installed with `pip`.
        
        ```bash
        pip install astrosource
        ```
        
        ### Install development version
        
        If you need to install the development branch, download from [GitHub](https://github.com/zemogle/astrosource) and from the root of the repo, run:
        
        ```bash
        cd astrosource
        pip install .
        ```
        
        or directly with the setup script
        
        ```bash
        cd astrosource
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        There are a few input options when running the scripts. You can either run the whole analysis at once or the individual stages.
        
        `--ra` *[required parameter]* Right Ascension of the target (in decimal)
        
        `--dec` *[required parameter]* Declination of the target (in decimal)
        
        `--target-file` *[required parameter]*
        
        `--indir` [parameter] Path of directory containing LCO data files. If none is given, astrosource assumes the current directory
        
        `--format` [parameter] input file format. If not `fz`, `fits`, or `fit` assumes the input files are photometry files with correct headers. If image files given, code will extra photometry from FITS extension. Defaults to `fz`.
        
        `--stars` [boolean flag] Step 1: Identify and match stars from each data file
        
        `--comparison` [boolean flag] Step 2: Identify non-varying stars to use for comparisons
        
        `--calc` [boolean flag] Step 3: Calculate the brightness change of the target
        
        `--phot` [boolean flag] Step 4: Photometry calculations for either differential or calibrated
        
        `--plot` [boolean flag] Step 5: Produce lightcurve plots
        
        `--full` [boolean flag] Run the whole code. This will run the following steps in this order `stars` > `comparison` > `calc` > `phot` > `plot`
        
        ### Extra options
        `--verbose` [boolean flag] Show all system messages for AstroSource
        
        `--detrend` [boolean flag] Detrend exoplanet data
        
        `--eebls` [boolean flag] EEBLS - box fitting to search for periodic transits
        
        `--calib` [boolean flag] Perform calibrated
        
        `--imgreject` [float] Image fraction rejection allowance. Defaults to `0.0`. Increasing this will allow AstroSource to reject some of your data files if there are not enough comparison stars.
        
        `--clean` [boolean flag] Remove all files except the original data files, and photometry files
        
        
        ### Example Usage
        
        ```bash
        astrosource --ra 154.9083708 --dec -9.8062778 --indir /path/to/your/data --full
        ```
        
        All the files generated will be stored in the directory you specify in `--indir`
        
        ### Tests
        
        If you are developing this package, you will want to run the tests. You will need `pytest` installed and then, from the `astrosource` directory within this repo, run:
        
        ```bash
        pytest
        ```
        
        To suppress the warning messages use:
        
        ```bash
        pytest --disable-pytest-warnings
        ```
        
        You may also want to install this in developer mode
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py develop
        ```
