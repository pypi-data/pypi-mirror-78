        ### Overview
        <div style="text-align: justify">
        Veroku is an open source library for building and performing inference with probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). PGMs
        provide a framework for performing efficient probabilistic inference with very high dimensional distributions. A typical
        example of a well-known type of PGM is the Kalman filter that can be used to obtain probabilistic estimates of a hidden
        state of a process or system, given noisy measurements. PGMs can in principle be used for any problem that involves
        uncertainty and is therefore applicable to many problems.</div> 
        
        Currently, veroku supports the following distributions:
        * Multivariate Gaussian
        * Multivariate Gaussian mixture
        * Multivariate categorical
        
        <div style="text-align: justify">
        These distributions can be used as factors to represent a factorised distribution. These factors can be used, together
        with the `cluster_graph` module to automatically create valid cluster graphs. Inference can be performed in these graphs
        using message passing algorithms. Currently only the LBU (Loopy Belief Update) message-passing algorithm is supported.

        ### Future Features
        
        To be added soon:
        * Example notebooks
        * Non-linear Gaussian distribution
        * Plate models (for efficiently specifying PGMs as modular/hierarchical templates)
        
        On the roadmap:
        * Dirichlet distribution
        * Wishart distribution
        * Normal-Wishart distribution
