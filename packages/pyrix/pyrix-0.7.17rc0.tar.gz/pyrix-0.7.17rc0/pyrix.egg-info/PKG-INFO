Description: # *Pyrix* 
        
        Well often times in the process of evolution we come across new stuff. Pyrix is one of them!
        Pyrix is a Clean-Room implemented ,standalone pure Python *Module/Library* which allows for improved, More intuitive Operations with Matrices and some of its related Fields such as vectors and linear Algebra.
        
        ### Why Pyrix?
        As computaional Mathematics has evolved we have reached a stage where traditional pen/paper mathematics is becoming more of a tradition. For example in the recent courses at MIT for Linear Algebra-18.06 Most lectures are focused on explaining abstract ideas and methods. For the most Part Computers have proven to be a lot faster to do large computations and with a precise, accurate solution.  
        I pitch Pyrix to be a Well implemented, Fast Performing Library to enable other students to learn Linear Algebra and Matrix Mathematics alongside. Being a student it's often a struggle to adopt to computational mathematics. Some courses leave students at an abstract view of concepts and its always upto the student to explore further.   
        With pyrix being Open-Source One can easily view the source code, understand how the matrix operations are performed within the computer.
        ### Getting Started with Pyrix
        
        For Python3 enviornment one can install the package with pip  
        ```
        $ pip install pyrix
        ```  
        \* some operating systems see pip for Python2 and pip3 for Python3 ,in that case  
        ```
        $ pip3 install pyrix
        ```
