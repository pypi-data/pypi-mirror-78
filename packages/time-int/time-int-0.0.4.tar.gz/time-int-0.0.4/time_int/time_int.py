"""Integer subclass to represent naive time since epoch.

TimeInt values are only good for the time between
   Jan 1, 1970 -> Apr 2, 2016
These limits are available as TimeInt.MIN and TimeInt.MAX
Within this range time is rounded to the nearest second.

The idea is to have the time small for storage while making
sort comparisons quick and easy.

Also provides a method to represent the time as a string
without extraneous parts (like including time of day when
value falls on midnight, or including seconds when value
falls on a minute etc).
