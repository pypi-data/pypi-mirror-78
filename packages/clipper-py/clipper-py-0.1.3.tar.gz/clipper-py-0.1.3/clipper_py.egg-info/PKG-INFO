        clipper-py is a Boost.Python wrapper exposing the C++ translation of the [Angus Johnson's Clipper library](http://angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) (6.4 Rev 495).
        
        clipper-py is tested and built against Python 3.8 on Arch Linux.
        
        **This project is very much a work-in-progress. Please contribute.**
        
        ## About Clipper
        > Clipper - an open source freeware library for clipping and offsetting lines and polygons.
        >
        > The Clipper library performs line & polygon clipping - intersection, union, difference & exclusive-or, and line & polygon offsetting. The library is based on Vatti's clipping algorithm.

        # Usage
        ##  Basic clipping example (based on Angus Johnson's Clipper library):
        ```python
        from clipper_py import Path, Paths, Clipper, IntPoint
        
        subj = Paths()
        subj.push(Path().push(IntPoint(180, 200)).push(IntPoint(260, 200)).push(IntPoint(260, 150)).push(IntPoint(180, 150)))
        subj.push(Path().push(IntPoint(215, 160)).push(IntPoint(230, 190)).push(IntPoint(200, 190)))
        print(subj, subj[0], subj[1])
        
        clip = Paths()
        clip.push(Path().push(IntPoint(190, 210)).push(IntPoint(240, 210)).push(IntPoint(240, 130)).push(IntPoint(190, 130)))
        print(clip, clip[0])
        
        clipper = Clipper(0)
        clipper.add_paths(subj, 'subject', True)
        clipper.add_paths(clip, 'clip', True)
        solution = clipper.execute('intersection', 'non-zero', 'non-zero')
        
        # solution: [[[240, 200], [190, 200], [190, 150], [240, 150]], [[200, 190], [230, 190], [215, 160]]]
        ```
