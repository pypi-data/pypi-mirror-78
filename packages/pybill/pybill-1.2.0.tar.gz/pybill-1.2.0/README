pybill
======

PyBill is Logilab tool used to produce PDF documents from XML files 
describing bills, debits, downpayments, claim forms or pro-formas.

The XML files are described in PyBill specific format (PBD-1.0). PyBill uses
additional XML configuration files to customize the rendering of the PDFs (logo,
sender address, sender bank data, internationalization, etc.) The chosen 
configuration can be directly set in the XML accounting file, into a dedicated
processing instruction.

The PDF documents are produced thanks to `reportlab` library. The XML data is
read and written thanks to `lxml` library. PyBill is entirely written in Python.
