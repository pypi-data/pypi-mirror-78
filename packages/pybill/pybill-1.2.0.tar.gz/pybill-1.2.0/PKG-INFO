        ======
        
        PyBill is Logilab tool used to produce PDF documents from XML files 
        describing bills, debits, downpayments, claim forms or pro-formas.
        
        The XML files are described in PyBill specific format (PBD-1.0). PyBill uses
        additional XML configuration files to customize the rendering of the PDFs (logo,
        sender address, sender bank data, internationalization, etc.) The chosen 
        configuration can be directly set in the XML accounting file, into a dedicated
        processing instruction.
        
        The PDF documents are produced thanks to `reportlab` library. The XML data is
        read and written thanks to `lxml` library. PyBill is entirely written in Python.
