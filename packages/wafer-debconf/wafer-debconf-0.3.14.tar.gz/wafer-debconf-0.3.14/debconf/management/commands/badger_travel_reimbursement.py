Dear {{ object.user.get_full_name }},

You have been granted a travel bursary for DebConf, and now is the time to
submit documentation for reimbursement. TL;DR: yes, this email is very long,
but it is all important, you need to read it in full to get travel money back!

Reimbursement for DebConf-related expenses will be processed by Software in the
Public Interest, for all Requesters including Europeans.

The amount you requested is {{ object.travel_bursary }} USD, and this is therefore the
maximum you'll be able to request for reimbursement.
This does not have to be requested *in* USD, you can request an equivalent
amount in your home currency.

To process the hundreds of reimbursement requests efficiently and
expeditiously, SPI requires consistency. All requests must include:

 1. an SPI Reimbursement Request Form [1] with accurate banking information as
    SPI uses TransferWise [2]
 2. an Expense Report generated using XE's Travel Expenses Calculator [3]
 3. sufficient documentation substantiating the expense report
 4. a declaration of compliance

And must be submitted to the debconf-reimbursements RT queue (instead of the
normal SPI reimbursement RT queue, listed on [1]).

[1]: https://spi-inc.org/treasurer/reimbursement-form/
[2]: https://transferwise.com
[3]: http://www.xe.com/travel-expenses-calculator/

Requesters must follow these steps:

Step 1: Prepare an Expense Report.
 • use http://www.xe.com/travel-expenses-calculator/ to prepare an expense report
 • enter Your Name
 • set Your Home Currency to the currency of your bank account.
 • leave/set Credit Card @ 3%, Debit Card @ 5%, Foreign Cash @ 5%, Traveller's Cheque @ 2%
 • enter Receipt Details, one row per receipt
   • specify the correct date of the transactions
   • set the currency per transaction to the currency you paid in
 • save as PDF

Step 2: Prepare an SPI Reimbursement Request Form
 • visit https://spi-inc.org/treasurer/reimbursement-form/
 • fill out the form and download the completed PDF
 • ensure your name exactly matches the Expense Report from Step 1
 • e̲n̲s̲u̲r̲e̲ ̲t̲h̲a̲t̲ ̲t̲h̲e̲ ̲b̲a̲n̲k̲i̲n̲g̲ ̲i̲n̲f̲o̲r̲m̲a̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ ̲i̲s̲ ̲a̲c̲c̲u̲r̲a̲t̲e̲ ̲a̲s̲ ̲i̲n̲c̲o̲r̲r̲e̲c̲t̲ ̲d̲e̲t̲a̲i̲l̲s̲ ̲a̲r̲e̲ ̲a̲
   m̲a̲j̲o̲r̲ ̲s̲o̲u̲r̲c̲e̲ ̲o̲f̲ ̲d̲e̲l̲a̲y̲s̲
 • the currency field is the currency of your bank account. Only say USD
   here if you have a USD bank account (e.g. because you live in the US)
 • save as PDF

Step 3: Collect and order your Receipts.
 • collect your receipts in the SAME ORDER as the rows in the Expense Report
 • if paper receipts, scan them with a multi-function device, converting to PDF
 • save as PDF

Step 4: Prepare the Submission Package.
 • collect into a single PDF, the following:
   • from step 2, the SPI Reimbursement Request From
   • from step 1, the Expense Report
   • from step 3, the Ordered Receipts
 • the poppler-utils package includes the pdfunite utility
   • usage: `pdfunite step2.pdf step1.pdf step3a.pdf step3b.pdf ... step3n.pdf {{ WAFER_CONFERENCE_NAME }}ReimbursementRequest-{{ short_full_name }}.pdf`
   • warning: ensure that you explicitly mention the destination filename
     ({{ WAFER_CONFERENCE_NAME }}ReimbursementRequest-{{ short_full_name }}.pdf) otherwise
     step3n.pdf is overwritten
   • notice: please name the file exactly as shown, substituting your name as
     entered in the SPI Reimbursement Request Form, for example,
     {{ WAFER_CONFERENCE_NAME }}ReimbursementRequest-{{ short_full_name }}.pdf
 • e̲n̲s̲u̲r̲e̲ ̲t̲h̲a̲t̲ ̲t̲h̲e̲ ̲e̲n̲t̲i̲r̲e̲ ̲S̲u̲b̲m̲i̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲ ̲P̲a̲c̲k̲a̲g̲e̲ ̲c̲a̲n̲ ̲b̲e̲ ̲e̲a̲s̲i̲l̲y̲ ̲u̲n̲d̲e̲r̲s̲t̲o̲o̲d̲ ̲a̲s̲ ̲p̲o̲o̲r̲

Step 5: Email the Submission Package.
 • prepare an email having these attributes
   • from: you
   • To: debconf-reimbursements@rt.spi-inc.org
   • subject: {{ WAFER_CONFERENCE_NAME }} Reimbursement Request for {{ object.user.get_full_name }}
   • attachment: the Submission Package ({{ WAFER_CONFERENCE_NAME }}ReimbursementRequest-{{ short_full_name }}.pdf) prepared in step 4
   • body: (the text below, please fix the claimed amount in the last line to
            match your actual request, in your local currency)
--- BEGIN TICKET TEXT ---
