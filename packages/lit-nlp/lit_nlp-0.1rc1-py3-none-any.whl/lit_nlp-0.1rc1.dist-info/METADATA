# Language Interpretability Tool (LIT)

The Language Interpretability Tool (LIT) is a visual, interactive
model-understanding tool for NLP models.

LIT is built to answer questions such as:

*   **What kind of examples** does my model perform poorly on?
*   **Why did my model make this prediction?** Can this prediction be attributed
    to adversarial behavior, or to undesirable priors in the training set?
*   **Does my model behave consistently** if I change things like textual style,
    verb tense, or pronoun gender?

The source code and documentation can be found at https://github.com/pair-code/lit.
