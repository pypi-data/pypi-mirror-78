        # pentagraph
        
        Graph representation and tools for programming with pentagame. _This is in active development an will be fully functional with the 0.0.1 release_
        
        ## Setup
        
        ### Pip
        
        You will need a working instance of [pip](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/).
        
        `python3 -m pip install pentagraph`
        
        ### Development
        
        Clone from github (requires [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)): `git clone https://github.com/Penta-Game/pentagraph`
        
        To install the dependencies you can use [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation): `poetry install`
        
        All files are required to have full typing support and need to pass [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) (This is checked in the `Python package` workflow on push/ pull request).
        
        ## License
        
        The source code of pentagraph is distributed according to the [MIT License by Cobalt](https://github.com/Penta-Game/pentagraph/blob/master/LICENSE)
        
        Libraries as listed in `pyproject.toml` please consider their respective Licenses before e.g. making commercial use of `pentagraph`.
        
        The same applies for [materialize](https://materializecss.com/) and [svg.js](https://svgjs.com/docs/3.0).
        
        ## Development Notes
        
        ### Contributing and CI
        
        There are 2 github actions workflows. The [`Python Packge`](https://github.com/Penta-Game/pentagraph/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Python+package%22) workflow is called on each push & merged pull request. This workflow runs test against the new version (`pytest tests/`) and checks if files in `pentagraph/` could be formatted with black. If either files could be formatted, the tests fail or the requirements are broken, the run fails. For black errors `format.py` can recursively execute black against all files in `pentagraph/` (you need to install black before using this). As an alternative `python -m black . --target-version py38` would be an appropriate direct call.
        
        The other workflow releases a new pip package on each github release. This release oriented workflow takes advantage of twine and github repository specific secrets. When this workflow crashes with authentication related errors contact [Cobalt](https://cobalt.rocks).
        
        Dependency managing is handled by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). Poetry is also used fo the packaging runs though you should update `requirements.txt` at least before creating a release with `poetry export -f requirements.txt > requirements.txt`.
        
        ### `pentagraph.lib.graphic`
        
        An easy-to-use way of displaying the `Board` taking advantage of Flask in combination with [materialize](https://materializecss.com/), [svg.js](https://svgjs.com/docs/3.0). The final board svg is created with a variation of resources from [boardgame](https://github.com/Penta-Game/boardgame).
        
        ### `pentagraph.lib.figures`
        
        Collection of Objects used for figure representation. These Objects also specifiy their respective drawing methods and types.
        
        ### `pentagraph.lib.graph`
        
        Graph representation as `Board` Object.
        
        ### `pentagraph.lib.math`
        
        Math usable for graphic representation of pentagame board. Python version of math used in `pentagraph.lib.graphic`.
        
        ### Docs
        
        Coming soon :cat:
        
        The docs will be produced with pelican and github pages.
