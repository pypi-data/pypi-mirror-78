# The Fil memory profiler for Python

Your code reads some data, processes it, and uses too much memory.
In order to reduce memory usage, you need to learn what code is responsible, and specifically what code is responsible for peak memory usage.

And that's exactly what Fil will help you find.
Fil an open source memory profiler designed for data processing applications written in Python, and includes native support for Jupyter.

At the moment it only runs on Linux and macOS.

For more information, including an example of the output, see https://pythonspeed.com/products/filmemoryprofiler/

## Installation

Assuming you're on macOS or Linux, and are using Python 3.6 or later, you can use either Conda or pip (or any tool that is pip-compatible and can install `manylinux2010` wheels).

### Conda

To install on Conda:

```console
$ conda install -c conda-forge filprofiler
```

### Pip

To install the latest version of Fil you'll need Pip 19 or newer.
You can check like this:

```console
$ pip --version
pip 19.3.0
```

If you're using something older than v19, you can upgrade by doing:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

If _that_ doesn't work, try running that in a virtualenv.

Assuming you have a new enough version of pip:

```console
$ pip install filprofiler
```

## Using Fil

### <a name="peak-jupyter">Measuring peak (high-water mark) memory usage in Jupyter</a>

To measure memory usage of some code in Jupyter you need to do three things:

1. Use an alternative kernel, "Python 3 with Fil".
   You can choose this kernel when you create a new notebook, or you can switch an existing notebook in the Kernel menu; there should be a "Change Kernel" option in there in both Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab.
2. Load the extension by doing `%load_ext filprofiler`.
3. Add the `%%filprofile` magic to the top of the cell with the code you wish to profile.

### <a name="peak-python">Measuring peak (high-water mark) memory usage for Python scripts</a>

Instead of doing:

```console
$ python yourscript.py --input-file=yourfile
```

Just do:

```
$ fil-profile run yourscript.py --input-file=yourfile
```

And it will generate a report.

### <a name="oom">Debugging out-of-memory crashes</a>

First, run `free` to figure out how much memory is available—in this case about 6.3GB—and then set a corresponding limit on virtual memory with `ulimit`:

```console
$ free -h
       total   used   free  shared  buff/cache  available
Mem:   7.7Gi  1.1Gi  6.3Gi    50Mi       334Mi      6.3Gi
Swap:  3.9Gi  3.0Gi  871Mi
$ ulimit -Sv 6300000
```

Then, run your program under Fil, and it will generate a SVG at the point in time when memory runs out:

```console
$ fil-profile run oom.py 
...
=fil-profile= Wrote memory usage flamegraph to fil-result/2020-06-15T12:37:13.033/out-of-memory.svg
```

## <a name="reducing-memory-usage">Reducing memory usage in your code</a>

You've found where memory usage is coming from—now what?

If you're using data processing or scientific computing libraries, I have written a relevant [guide to reducing memory usage](https://pythonspeed.com/datascience/).

## What Fil tracks

Fil will track memory allocated by:

* Normal Python code.
* C code using `malloc()`/`calloc()`/`realloc()`/`posix_memalign()`.
* C++ code using `new` (including via `aligned_alloc()`).
* Anonymous `mmap()`s.
* Fortran 90 explicitly allocated memory (tested with gcc's `gfortran`).

Still not supported, but planned:

* `mremap()` (resizing of `mmap()`).
* File-backed `mmap()`.
  The usage here is inconsistent since the OS can swap it in or out, so probably supporting this will involve a different kind of resource usage.
* Other forms of shared memory, need to investigate if any of them allow sufficient allocation.
* Anonymous `mmap()`s created via `/dev/zero` (not common, since it's not cross-platform, e.g. macOS doesn't support this).
* `memfd_create()`.
* Possibly `memalign`, `valloc()`, `pvalloc()`, `reallocarray()`.
