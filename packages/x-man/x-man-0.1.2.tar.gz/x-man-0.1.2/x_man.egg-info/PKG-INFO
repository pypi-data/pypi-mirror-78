        [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/igrek51%2Fx-man.svg)](https://github.com/igrek51/x-man)
        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/x-man.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/x-man)
        
        `Xman` is a HTTP proxy recording & replaying requests.  
        It acts as an extensible "Man in the middle" server, which can:  
        - forward requests to other address
        - return cached results immediately without need to proxying
        - record incoming requests to a file, restore responses from there
        - throttle requests when clients are making them too frequently
        - transform requests & responses on the fly (eg. replace path with regex)
        
        With `x-man` you can setup a mock server imitating a real server:  
        1. Configure forwarding to a real server. Enable recording requests and replaying responses,
        2. Make some typical requests. Request-response entries will be recorded to a file.
        3. You can turn off real server now. Responses are returned from cache.
        4. Use it to setup lighweight HTTP service mock.
        
        # Installation
        ```shell
        pip3 install x-man
        ```
        
        Python 3.6 (or newer) is required.

        Listen on SSL port 8443, forward requests to http://127.0.0.1:8000 with caching.
        When same request comes, cached response will be returned. 
        ```console
        $ x-man http://127.0.0.1:8000 --listen-port 8443 --listen-ssl=true --replay=true
        [2020-07-29 18:19:58] [DEBUG] loaded request-response pairs record_file=tape.json read_entries=2 distinct_entries=1
        [2020-07-29 18:19:58] [INFO ] Listening on HTTPS port 8443...
        ```
        
        # Extensions
        If you need more customization, you can specify extension file, where you can implement your custom behaviour.
        In order to do that you must create Python script and pass its filename by parameter: `x-man --ext ext.py`.
        
        In extension file you can specify request / response mappers or custom comparator deciding which requests should be treated as the same. Using that you can achieve custom behaviour for some particular type of requests.
        
        Implement your function in place of one of the following functions:
        - `transform_request(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpRequest` - Transforms each incoming Request before further processing (caching, forwarding).
        - `transform_response(request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse) -> HttpResponse` - Transforms each Response before sending it.
        - `can_be_cached(request: HttpRequest) -> bool` - Indicates whether particular request could be saved / restored from cache.
        - `cache_request_traits(request: HttpRequest) -> Tuple` - Gets tuple denoting request uniqueness. Requests with same results are treated as the same when caching.
        - `override_config(config: Config)` - Overrides default parameters in config.
        
        ## Extensions example
        **ext.py**
        ```python
        from typing import Tuple
        
        from nuclear.sublog import log
        
        from x_man.cache import sorted_dict_trait
        from x_man.config import Config
        from x_man.request import HttpRequest
        from x_man.response import HttpResponse
        from x_man.transform import replace_request_path
        
        
        def transform_request(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpRequest:
            """Transforms each incoming Request before further processing (caching, forwarding)."""
            return replace_request_path(request, r'^/path/(.+?)(/[a-z]+)(/.*)', r'\3')
        
        
        def transform_response(request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse) -> HttpResponse:
            """Transforms each Response before sending it."""
            if request.path.startswith('/api'):
                log.debug('Found Ya', path=request.path)
                response = response.set_content('{"payload": "anythingyouwish"}"')
            return response
        
        
        def can_be_cached(request: HttpRequest) -> bool:
            """Indicates whether particular request could be saved / restored from cache."""
            return request.method in {'get', 'post'}
        
        
        def cache_request_traits(request: HttpRequest) -> Tuple:
            """Gets tuple denoting request uniqueness. Requests with same results are treated as the same when caching."""
            return request.method, request.path, request.content, sorted_dict_trait(request.headers)
        
        
        def override_config(config: Config):
            """Overrides default parameters in config."""
            config.verbose = True
        
        ```
