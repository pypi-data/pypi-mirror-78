This is a Python library that allows you to do the following calculations:
acceleration, force, frequency, velocity, wavelenght and angular_velocity.

Remember to use the International System of Units for the variables.
If you have any question, send me a DM on my Instagram: @miguel_barroso6

Will be uploaded daily updates that will add other features and new calculus.
