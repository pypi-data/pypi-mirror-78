dfDateTime, or Digital Forensics date and time, provides date and time objects
to preserve accuracy and precision.

dfDateTime, originates from the dfVFS project [https://github.com/log2timeline/dfvfs]
and the dfWinReg project [//github.com/log2timeline/dfvfs]. It was largely
rewritten and made into a stand-alone project to provide more flexibility and
allow other projects to make use of the Digital Forensics date and time objects.

dfDateTime is currently developed and maintained by:
* Daniel White
* Joachim Metz
