# Date and time values
## Terminology

**Calendar**: a system of organising days.

**Epoch**: a reference point from which time is measured.

**Leap second**: a leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally
applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in order to keep its time of day
close to the mean solar time.

## Accuracy and precision

* **accuracy** is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true
value;
* **precision** is the closeness of agreement among a set of results.

In NTFS data and time values are stored using a [FILETIME structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime).
The FILETIME structure stores a date and time value as a 64-bit integer that
represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since "January 1, 1601
00:00:00.0000000 UTC". This provides an upper bound of a 100-nanosecond
interval **data granularity**. For disambiguation we'll refer to this as
**datetime storage granularity**.

However this does not have to mean that the actual value stored within the
FILETIME structure has a 100-nanosecond interval data granularity. E.g. the
FILETIME MSDN article also mentions that on NTFS, the access time has a
**resolution** of 1 hour. For disambiguation the term resolution is comparable
with that of [Display resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution)
or [Audio resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_bit_depth), we'll
refer to this as **datetime value granularity**.

The FILETIME MSDN article also mentions that some values should be interpreted
not as date and time values e.g. 0xFFFFFFFF can be used to specify that a
file's previous access time should be preserved, or 0 to specify that the date
and time value is not set. For disambiguation we'll refer to this as **datetime
value semantics** (in other words meaning or representation).

### Digital forensics significance

A large part of digital forensic analysis is about the interpretation of
computer data. If date and time values are converted from a storage format to
another storage format or a string representation we are likely to change
granularity and semantics in the process. If the analyst is aware of this the
impact should be minimal, however if we wish to have automation assisted
analysis we'll have to preserve concepts of granularity and semantics and
represent them in a machine process-able manner. So that the automation can
distinguish between a FILETIME date and time value that is not set versus a
FILETIME date and time value that represents "January 1, 1601 00:00:00.0000000
UTC".

Another aspect relevant to digital forensic analysis is how to represent a
datetime value with a value granularity of 1 day (e.g. FAT access time) in a
timeline of microseconds, where the analyst is only interested in the events
that occurred within a specific hour on that day. Technically the access time
should be included in the resulting timeline since the access could have
occurred during that specific hour.

## FAT date and time
### Characteristics

Attribute | Description
--- | ---
Supported date range | 1980-01-01 00:00:00 through 2107-12-31 23:59:58
Storage granularity | 2-second intervals
Time zone | externally represented, typically local time

Sometimes 2099-12-31 23:59:58 is defined as the upper bound of DOS date and
time. Also see: [Time formatting and storage bugs - Year 2100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_formatting_and_storage_bugs#Year_2100)

### Format

The FAT (or DOS) date is a 16-bit value that consists of:

Offset | Size | Description
--- | --- | ---
0.0 | 5 bits | day of month, where 1 is the first day of the month
0.5 | 4 bits | month, where January is represented by 1
1.1 | 7 bits | year, ranging from 1980 through

The FAT (or DOS) time is a 16-bit value that consists of:

--- | --- | ---
0.0 | 5 bits | number of 2-second intervals, ranging from 0 through 29
0.5 | 6 bits | minutes, ranging from 0 through 59

## FILETIME
### Characteristics

Attribute | Description
--- | ---
Supported date range | 1601-01-01 00:00:00.0000000 through ...
Storage granularity | 100-nanosecond intervals
Time zone | externally represented, typically UTC

The actual upper bound of the supported date range is unclear. Also see:
[Latest possible FILETIME](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9999393/latest-possible-filetime)

### Format

The FILETIME structure is 8 bytes of size and consists of:

Offset | Size | Description
--- | --- | ---
0 | 4 | lower 32-bit of the 64-bit timestamp
4 | 4 | upper 32-bit of the 64-bit timestamp

The FILETIME should be treated as a structure when stored and passed to Windows
API functions. However it can be combined into a 64-bit integer, which will be
indicated as a FILETIME timestamp, containing the number of seconds since
1601-01-01 00:00:00.0000000.

An empty (or unset) FILETIME timestamp can be represented by 0, however the
meaning can differ depending on the context in which the timestamp is used.

Certain values of FILETIME such as { 0xffffffff, 0xffffffff } for the
SetFileTime Windows API function are overloaded with a special meaning.
