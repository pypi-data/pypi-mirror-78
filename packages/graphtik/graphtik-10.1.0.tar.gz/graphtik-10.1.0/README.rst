Lightweight computation graphs for Python
-----------------------------------------

**Graphtik** is a library to design, plot & execute *graphs of functions*
(a.k.a pipeline) that consume and populate (possibly nested) data,
based on whether values for those data (a.k.a dependencies) exist.

- The API posits a fair compromise between features and complexity, without precluding any.
- It can be used as is to build machine learning pipelines for data science projects.
- It should be extendable to act as the core for a custom ETL engine, a workflow-processor
  for interdependent tasks & files like GNU Make, or a spreadsheet calculation engine.

.. Note::
    *Graphtik* `sprang <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPgtg2l6v3uDS81hLOcFOZxIBLCnHGrcFOh3pFRIDio/edit#gid=0>`_
    from `Graphkit`_ (summer 2019, v1.2.2) to `experiment
    <https://github.com/yahoo/graphkit/issues/>`_ with Python 3.6+ features,
    but has diverged significantly with enhancements ever since.

.. _features:

Features
--------

- Can assemble existing functions without modifications into `pipeline`\s.
- `dependency` resolution can bypass calculation cycles based on data given and asked.
- Support functions with `optional <optionals>` input args and/or `varargs <varargish>`.
- Support functions with `partial outputs`; keep working even if certain `endured` operations fail.
- Support `alias` of function `provides` to avoid the need for trivial conveyor operations.
- Default `conveyor operation` to easily pass (possibly *nested*) dependencies around.
- `Merge <operation merging>` or `nest <operation nesting>` sub-pipelines.
- `Hierarchical dependencies <subdoc>` may access data values deep in `solution`
  with `json pointer path` expressions.
- Hierarchical dependencies annotated as `implicit` imply which subdoc dependency
  the function reads or writes in the parent-doc.
- Denote and schedule `sideffects` on `dependency` values, to update them repeatedly,
  avoiding cycles (e.g. to add columns into :class:`pandas.DataFrame`\s).
- Deterministic pre-decided `execution plan`  (excepting *partial-outputs* or
  *endured operations*).
- Early `eviction` of intermediate results from `solution`, to optimize memory footprint.
- Solution tracks all intermediate `overwritten <overwrite>` values for the same dependency.
- Parallel execution (but underdeveloped).
- Elaborate plotting with configurable `plot theme`\s.
- Integration with Sphinx sites with the new :rst:dir:`graphtik` directive.
- Authored with :ref:`debugging <debugging>` in mind.

Anti-features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- It's not an orchestrator for long-running tasks, nor a calendar scheduler -
  `Apache Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org/>`_ and `Luigi <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/>`_
  may help for that.

- It's not really a parallelizing optimizer, neither a map-reduce framework - look
  additionally at `Dask <https://dask.org/>`_, `IpyParallel
  <https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, `Celery
  <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html>`_,
  Hive, Pig, Spark, Hadoop, etc.


Quick start
-----------

Hereâ€™s how to install:

::

   pip install graphtik

OR with various "extras" dependencies, such as, for plotting::

   pip install graphtik[plot]

. Tip::
    Supported extras:

    **plot**
        for plotting with `Graphviz`_,
    **matplot**
        for plotting in *maplotlib* windows
    **sphinx**
        for embedding plots in *sphinx*\-generated sites,
    **test**
        for running *pytest*\s,
    **dill**
        may help for pickling `parallel` tasks - see `marshalling` term
        and ``set_marshal_tasks()`` configuration.
    **all**
        all of the above, plus development libraries, eg *black* formatter.
    **dev**
        like *all*

Let's build a *graphtik* computation graph that produces x3 outputs
out of 2 inputs `a` and `b`:

- `a x b`
- `a - a x b`
- `|a - a x b| ^ 3`

..

>>> from graphtik import compose, operation
>>> from operator import mul, sub

>>> @operation(name="abs qubed",
...            needs=["a_minus_ab"],
...            provides=["abs_a_minus_ab_cubed"])
... def abs_qubed(a):
...     return abs(a) ** 3

Compose the ``abspow`` function along the ``mul`` & ``sub``  built-ins
into a computation graph:

>>> graphop = compose("graphop",
...     operation(needs=["a", "b"], provides=["ab"])(mul),
...     operation(needs=["a", "ab"], provides=["a_minus_ab"])(sub),
...     abs_qubed,
... )
>>> graphop
Pipeline('graphop', needs=['a', 'b', 'ab', 'a_minus_ab'],
                    provides=['ab', 'a_minus_ab', 'abs_a_minus_ab_cubed'],
                    x3 ops: mul, sub, abs qubed)

Run the graph and request all of the outputs:

>>> graphop(a=2, b=5)
{'a': 2, 'b': 5, 'ab': 10, 'a_minus_ab': -8, 'abs_a_minus_ab_cubed': 512}

... or request a subset of outputs:

>>> solution = graphop.compute({'a': 2, 'b': 5}, outputs=["a_minus_ab"])
>>> solution
{'a_minus_ab': -8}

... and plot the results (if in *jupyter*, no need to create the file):

>>> solution.plot('executed_3ops.svg')  # doctest: +SKIP
