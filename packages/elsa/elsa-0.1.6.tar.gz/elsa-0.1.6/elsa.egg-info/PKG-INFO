Description: elsa
        ====
        
        Elsa will help you build your `Frozen-Flask <http://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/>`_ based website and deploy it to GitHub pages.
        It's based on scripts from `PyLadies.cz repo <https://github.com/PyLadiesCZ/pyladies.cz>`_ and is distributed under the terms of the MIT license, see LICENSE (does not apply for the image below). It requires Python 3.

        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        Create you Flask app and give it to ``elsa.cli()``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from flask import Flask
        
            app = Flask(...)
        
            # do stuff with app
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                from elsa import cli
                cli(app, base_url='https://example.com')
        
        This will add command line interface to the script, enabling you to use it like this:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            python foo.py serve  # serves the site, no freezing, so you can check it quickly
            python foo.py freeze  # freezes the site, i.e. makes a HTML snapshot
            python foo.py deploy  # deploys the frozen site to GitHub pages
        
        See more options with ``--help``.
        
        Follow the `quickstart tutorial
        <https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/blob/master/QUICKSTART.rst>`_
        for more information.
        
        Travis CI based deployment
        --------------------------
        
        Travis CI is (in this context) a tool, that allows you to deploy the site automatically to GitHub pages after every push.
        All you have to do is tell Travis to run Elsa and provide a GitHub token.
        Elsa on Travis will freeze the site and deploy it frozen to GitHub pages.
        Elsa knows it's being run on Travis and will use the provided GitHub token to gain push permissions.
        Elsa will push force to ``gh-pages`` branch in a single commit rewriting the history and all manual changes of that branch.
        
        Here is an example ``.travis.yml`` file for automatic deployment. It assumes elsa and other requirements are in ``requirements.txt`` and that you are familiar with Travis CI (so it's not very verbose):
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            language: python
            python:
                - '3.6'
            script:
                - 'python foo.py freeze'
            env:
              global:
                - secure: "blahblah"  # gem install travis; travis encrypt GITHUB_TOKEN=xyz --add
            deploy:
                provider: script
                skip_cleanup: true
                script: 'python foo.py deploy --no-freeze --push'
                on:
                    branch: master
                    repo: only/yours
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To run the test suite, install `tox <http://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_ and run it::
        
            tox
        
        Elsa uses pytest, so if you are familiar with it, feel free to run  it directly.
        
        
        
        Further notes
        -------------
        
        URLs
        ~~~~
        
        When you use URLs without trailing slash (e.g. ``https://example.com/foobar``), GitHub pages would serve the pages with bad Content-Type header
        (``application/octet-stream`` instead of ``text/html``) and the browser would attempt to download it.
        That's why Elsa will not allow such thing and will treat ``MimetypeMismatchWarning`` from Frozen-Flask as error.
        Make sure to use URLs with trailing slash (e.g. ``https://example.com/foobar/``) instead, so Frozen-Flask will create ``index.html`` in a folder and GitHub pages will use proper content type.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.1.6
        -----
        
        * Add the ``--host`` option to CLI.
          It corresponds to ``flask run``'s ``--host`` option.
        * When serving (with ``serve`` or ``freeze --serve``), Elsa now listens on
          Flask's default address, ``127.0.0.1``. The server is not visible
          externally.
          Use ``--host=0.0.0.0`` to select the original, less secure behavior. (`#67`_)
        
        .. _#67: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/pull/67
        
        0.1.5
        -----
        
        * Add ``--verbose`` option for the CLI. If used, it prints all frozen URLs
          to standard error. Useful when freezing big projects on Travis CI. (`#51`_)
        
        .. _#51: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/pull/51
        
        0.1.4
        -----
        
        * Add ``invoke_cli`` option for the ``cli`` function.
          If set to ``False``, it only returns the cli for further extending. (`#45`_)
        * Don't remove the remote tracking branch when ``--no-push`` is used (fixes `#41`_)
        * Improve handling of ``FrozenFlaskWarning`` (`#37`_)
        * Add the ``--show-git-push-stderr`` option to make deploy more verbose,
          this can help debug problems, but is potentially dangerous, hence the output
          of ``git push`` is hidden by default. (`#37`_)
        
        .. _#37: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/pull/37
        .. _#41: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/issues/41
        .. _#45: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/pull/45
        
        0.1.3
        -----
        
        * Only treat Frozen-Flask warnings as errors, not other warnings (`#34`_)
        * Add a ``--remote`` option for ``deploy`` to use a custom git remote
        * Be consistent on local vs Travis CI deployment, always erase the history
          of the ``gh-pages`` branch (actually fixes `#14`_)
        
        .. _#14: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/issues/14
        .. _#34: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/pull/34
        
        
        0.1.2
        -----
        
        * **Security:** Do not display the remote URL when pushing gh-pages branch.
          If you used Elsa 0.1 or 0.1.1 on Travis CI, revoke your GitHub
          token, it was probably leaked in the log. (`#25`_)
        
        .. _#25: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/issues/25
        
        
        0.1.1
        -----
        
        * Fix a problem with Travis CI based deployment
        
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        * Add a test suite
        * Treat Frozen-Flask warnings as errors
        * **Important:** It is now recommended to run ``freeze`` in ``.travis.yml``
          ``script`` section to catch problems in Pull Requests etc.
        * **Important:**  This version of Elsa will warn if you use the ``deploy``
          command without specifying ``--push`` or ``--no-push`` explicitly.
          In a future release, it will switch to *not* pushing the built pages by
          default.
        * Remove the dependency on ``sh`` to improve compatibility with Windows
        * Supports Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
        * The ``gh-branch`` is purged before the deploying commit (`#14`_)
        * It is possible to shutdown the server via a special POST request (`#21`_)
        
        .. _#14: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/issues/14
        .. _#21: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/pull/21
        
        
        0.1.dev4
        --------
        
        * Set template auto_reload flag directly in serve mode (`#8`_)
        
        .. _#8: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/issues/8
        
        
        0.1.dev3
        --------
        
        * Set TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD by default (`#5`_)
        * Suppress a bogus warning about CNAME mime type (`#7`_)
        
        .. _#5: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/issues/5
        .. _#7: https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/issues/7
        
        
        0.1.dev2
        --------
        
        * The CNAME route is now created automatically
        
        
        0.1.dev1
        --------
        
        * Initial implementation from
          `PyLadies.cz <https://github.com/PyLadiesCZ/pyladies.cz>`_
