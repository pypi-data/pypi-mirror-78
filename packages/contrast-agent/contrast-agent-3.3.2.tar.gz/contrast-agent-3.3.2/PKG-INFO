Description: # Contrast Python Agent
        
        
        ## Overview
        
        The Contrast Python agent provides runtime protection of Django, Flask and
        Pyramid web applications.

        ### About Python
        
        The Python agent is a WSGI- and framework-specific middleware that's compatible
        with the most popular web application frameworks. The agent's goal is to be
        fully WSGI compatible along with other web frameworks.
        
        #### Protect Mode
        
        In Protect mode, the Python agent inspects HTTP requests to identify
        potentially harmful input vectors from its position within the middleware
        stack. During the request, the agent monitors database queries, file writes and
        other potentially damaging actions resulting from the request. At the end of
        the request, the agent checks the rendered output for successful attacks, and
        can block a successful attack from being forwarded to the application user. The
        service sends the details of the attack to the Contrast application, which then
        sends you an alert and displays attack details in the interface.
        
        ### Using the Agent
        
        To start protecting your application, download the Python agent and create a
        configuration file as described in the **Installation** section. The Python
        agent is installed as a standard Python package, and communicates with a
        standalone Contrast Service that runs outside your application.
        
        ## Supported Technologies
        
        The Python agent supports Python versions 2.7+ and 3.5 to 3.8. It supports the
        following web frameworks:
        
        * Django: 1.10+, 2.0+, 3.0+ (Django 2 and 3 are Python 3 only)
        * Flask: 0.10 - 0.12 and 1.0+
        * Pyramid: 1.4.5 and 1.9+ (Beta)
        * Pylons: 1.0+
        
        >**Note:** The Python agent is meant to be WSGI compatible. It may be
        compatible with other WSGI applications as long as the guidelines are followed.
        
        ### Database Support
        
        The Python Agent has database support for:
        
        * SQLite3 (`sqlite3` and `pysqlite2`)
        * PostgreSQL (`psycopg2`)
        * MySQL (`pymysql`)
        * Cassandra 1.X (`pycassa`)
        
        ### NoSQL Support
        
        The Python Agent has NoSQL support for:
        
        * Mongo (`pymongo`)
        
        ### ORM Support
        
        The Python Agent has ORM support for:
        
        * SQLAlchemy (`SQLAlchemy`)
        * Flask-SQLAlchemy (`Flask-SQLAlchemy`)
        
        ### OS Support
        
        Agent testing is done on **64-bit OSX** and **64-bit Linux**. The agent has no
        C dependencies, and may work in other operating system environments.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install the Contrast agent into your Python application, you must complete
        the following steps.
        
        1. Add *contrast-agent-[version].tar.gz* to the application's
        *requirements.txt* (see **Standard Setup**).
        2. Provide the agent with a valid *contrast_security.yaml* configuration file
        (see **Configuration**).
        
        ### Standard Setup
        
        The *contrast-agent-[version].tar.gz* is a standard packaged Python
        library that you can add to the application's *requirements.txt*.
        
        To use Contrast, add this line to your application's *requirements.txt* after
        downloading the agent:
        
        ```
        ./path/to/contrast-agent-[version].tar.gz
        ```
        
        After editing the *requirements.txt* you can install normally with:
        
        ``` bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ### Manual Setup
        
        If you would prefer to install the Contrast agent manually, download the
        *contrast-agent-[version].tar.gz* file to a local directory and run:
        
        ``` bash
        pip install ./path/to/contrast-agent-[version].tar.gz
        ```
        
        ### Middleware Inclusion
        
        To hook into incoming requests and outbound responses, you need to add the
        Contrast middleware to your application. To do this, use the appropriate
        guidance for your framework.
        
        #### Django
        
        For Django 1.10+,  2.0+, and 3.0+, add the following to your *settings.py* file:
        
        ``` python
        MIDDLEWARE = [
          # OTHER MIDDLEWARE
          'contrast.agent.middlewares.django_middleware.DjangoMiddleware'
        ]
        ```
        
        Older versions of Django have a different architecture for middlewares. For
        Django 1.6 to 1.9, add the following in your *settings.py* file:
        
        ``` python
        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
          # OTHER MIDDLEWARE
          'contrast.agent.middlewares.legacy_django_middleware.DjangoMiddleware'
        ]
        ```
        
        #### Flask
        
        ``` python
        import Flask
        from contrast.agent.middlewares.flask_middleware import FlaskMiddleware as ContrastMiddleware
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        app.wsgi_app = ContrastMiddleware(app)
        ```
        
        #### Pyramid
        
        ``` python
        from pyramid.config import Configurator
        
        config = Configurator()
        config.add_tween('contrast.agent.middlewares.pyramid_middleware.PyramidMiddleware')
        ```
        
        #### WSGI
        
        ``` python
        from contrast.agent.middlewares.wsgi_middleware import WSGIMiddleware as ContrastMiddleware
        
        # other app code
        
        app = get_wsgi_application()
        app = ContrastMiddleware(app)
        ```
        
        #### Pylons
        
        ``` python
        from pylons.wsgiapp import PylonsApp
        from contrast.agent.middlewares.wsgi_middleware import WSGIMiddleware as ContrastMiddleware
        
        app = PylonsApp()
        app = ContrastMiddleware(app)
        ```
        
        ### Next Steps
        
        Once the installation process is complete, you must provide the agent with a
        *contrast_security.yaml* configuration file as outlined in the
        **Configuration** section below.
        
        
        ## Configuration
        
        The Python agent and Contrast Service use a YAML file to configure their
        behavior.
        
        ### File Location
        
        The configuration file must be named *contrast_security.yaml* or
        *contrast_security.yml* no matter where it's located. The Python agent loads
        the configuration YAML from the following paths in order of precedence:
        
        1. Any path saved in the environment variable `CONTRAST_CONFIG_PATH`
        2. The settings directory within the current directory (e.g.,
        *./settings/contrast_security.yaml*)
        3. The current working directory (e.g., *./contrast_security.yaml*)
        4. Within the server's *etc/contrast/python/* directory (e.g.,
        */etc/contrast/python/contrast_security.yaml*)
        5. Within the server's *etc/contrast/* directory (e.g.,
        */etc/contrast/contrast_security.yaml*)
        
        The agent and service may share a common configuration file, but only some
        options and sections are applicable to each process.
        
        ### Configuration Options
        
        Download a standard configuration file from the Contrast Dashboard. You must
        place the file in one of the standard locations described above, and define the
        following fields, at a minimum:
        
        ``` yaml
        agent:
          service:
            host:
            port:
        ```
        
        For additional information, see the [Contrast Open
        Docs](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/installation-pythonconfig.html).
        
        ### *Optional* Start the Service Manually
        The Python agent will attempt to start the Contrast Service on it's own.
        However, if you wish to run the Service separately please follow these steps.
        
        Like the contrast-agent, the contrast-service requires a configuration
        file. Place the configuration YAML file in the same directory as the
        contrast-service.
        
        The contrast-service is an executable Go Service that can be run directly from
        the application directory. This can be done by executing:
        
        - Linux/OSX:
            `./contrast-service`
        - Windows:
            `./contrast-service.exe`
