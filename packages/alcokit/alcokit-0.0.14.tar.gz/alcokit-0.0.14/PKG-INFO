Description: # ALgorithmic COmposition KIT (alcokit)
        This is a small library for performing various tasks on musical data in the frequency domain. The goal of `alcokit` is to offer practical abstractions to programming composers and musicians.  
        
        Available functionalities range from time-segmentation and polyphonic pitch detection to efficient hdf5 storage and sequence modeling.
        
        `alcokit` is still in early development. Documentation and use-case examples are coming soon...
