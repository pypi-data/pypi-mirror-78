My plotting package! I got fed up spending half a day or more each time i wanted to do some new plots or charts in python.

I never really settled on any single plotting package and refuse to learn matplotlib!

So instead anytime i have a new type of plot i need to do that could be useful again to me in future, i'm going to pick whatever plotting lib does it best/easiest for me, try generalise it a bit and add it as functionality into this package.

This was also a good excuse for me to learn a bit about developing python packages and pushing them to pypi.

Use at you own peril! Feel free to open issues and all that good stuff.

This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template. Cookiecutter is awesome and the `TalkPython course`_ on it is great.
