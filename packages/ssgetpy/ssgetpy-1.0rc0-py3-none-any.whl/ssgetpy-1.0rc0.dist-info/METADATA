# SSGETPY: Search and download sparse matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection
![Python package](https://github.com/drdarshan/PyUFGet/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/drdarshan/ssgetpy/master?filepath=demo.ipynb)


`ssgetpy` is a little Python library and command-line program to search, filter and download matrices from the [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/matrices.html) similar to the existing Java and MATLAB tools. 

The index of matrices is created from the same CSV file used by the
Java interface. However, the index in cached in a local SQLite
database to make querying it more convenient. 

## Requirements and installation

`ssgetpy` works with Python 3.6 or above. Besides the standard
library, it depends on `requests` and `tqdm`. Since `ssgetpy` doesn't
actually parse matrix data, it doesn't require dependencies like
`NumPy` or `SciPy`.

To install, simply run:
```
pip install ssgetpy
```

This will install the `ssgetpy` Python module as well as a `ssgetpy` command-line script. 

From Python, run ``import ssgetpy`` and type ``help(ssgetpy)`` to get a detailed
help message on how to use ``ssgetpy`` to search and download sparse matrices.

From the command-line, run ``ssgetpy`` or ``ssgetpy --help`` to see the
list of options.

## Examples
Make sure you first run ``from ssgetpy import search, fetch``. Replace
``fetch`` with ``search`` to only return the corresponding ``Matrix`` objects
without downloading them.

* Download matrix with ID 42 in the MatrixMarket format: ``fetch(42)``
* Download matrices in the Harwell-Boeing collection with less than
  1000 non-zeros: ``fetch(group = 'HB', nzbounds = (None, 1000))``
* Download only the first 5 problems arising from structural analysis:
  ``fetch(kind = "structural", limit = 5)``
* Download the problems in the previous example as MATLAB .MAT files: ``fetch(kind = "structural", format = "MAT", limit = 5)``

For more examples, please see the accompanying [Jupyter notebook](demo.ipynb)
