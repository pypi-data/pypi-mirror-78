        SDCflows (susceptibility distortion correction workflows) is a library of workflows
        to correct for distortions typically remaining after reconstruction in images
        acquired with EPI (echo-planar imaging) MR schemes.
        It is designed to provide an easily accessible, state-of-the-art interface that is
        robust to differences in scan acquisition protocols and that requires minimal user input.
        
        This open-source neuroimaging data processing tool is being developed as a part of
        the MRI image analysis and reproducibility platform offered by the CRN.
