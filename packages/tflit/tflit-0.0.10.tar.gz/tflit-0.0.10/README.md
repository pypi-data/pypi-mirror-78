# tflit ðŸ”¥
Because WTH `tflite_runtime`?

`interpreter.invoke()`?
`interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], X)`?

Having to select a platform-specific url from [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python)?

Uh no. certainly not ðŸ”¥.

What this does:
 - Detects your platform + Python version so you don't have to pick the right url and you can add `tflite_runtime` as a dependency **without having to pick a single platform to support.**
 - Creates a familiar `keras`-like interface for models, so you can do `tflit.Model(path).predict(X)` without ever having to think about tensor indexes or three step predictions, or batching.


## Install

```bash
pip install tflit
```

## Usage

I tried to provide an interface as similar to Keras as possible.

```python
import tflit

model = tflit.Model('path/to/model.tflite')
model.summary()  # prints input and output details

print(model.input_shape)   # (10, 30)  - a single input
print(model.output_shape)  # [(5, 2), (1, 2)]  - two outputs
print(model.dtype)         # 'float32'

# *see notes below
print(model.input_names)   # may not preserve names (based on how you export)
print(model.output_names)  # doesn't preserve names atm

# predict over batches of outputs.
y_pred = model.predict(np.random.randn(32, 10, 30))

# predict single output at a time
y_pred = model.predict_batch(np.random.randn(1, 10, 30))
```


## Notes
 - It's possible that `tflite_runtime` may not have a build for your system. Check [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python) link to verify.

 - There's a bug with the current `tflite` converter where it doesn't copy over the input and output names.

    However, if you do this when you're exporting, the input names will be saved:
    ```python
    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
    converter.experimental_new_converter = True  # <<< this
    tflite_model = converter.convert()
    ```

    But still no luck with the output names :/. To be clear, this is a tensorflow issue and I have no control over this.


 - I intended to have a `model.set_batch_size` method to change the batch size at runtime, but it doesn't currently work because tflite freaks out about there being an increased tensor size (it doesn't know how to broadcast). This is also a tensorflow issue.

    For the time being, we just compute one batch at a time and concatenate them at the end. If the model's fixed batch size doesn't divide evenly, it will throw an error. By default, tflite converts `None` batch sizes to `1` so most of the time it won't be a problem. To compute a single frame, it is more efficient to use `model.predict_batch(X)` directly.

I would love to get both of these resolved, but they are out of my control and I don't really have the bandwidth or the urgent need to have these resolved.
