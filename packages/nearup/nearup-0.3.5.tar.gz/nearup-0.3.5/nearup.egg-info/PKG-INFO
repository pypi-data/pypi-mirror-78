        Public scripts to launch near betanet and testnet node
        
        # Usage
        
        ## Prerequisite
        
        Before you proceed, make sure you have the following software installed:
        
        * Python 3 and Pip3
        
        ### Ubuntu Prerequisite Installation
        
        Here is the installation command:
        
        ```
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
        ```
        
        ## Install
        
        ```
        pip3 install nearup
        ```
        
        Add nearup to your PATH in ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc or appropriate shell config
        ```
        export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
        ```
        
        ## Start
        
        ### Using Officially Compiled Binary (recommended for running on servers)
        
        Currently, officially compiled binaries are available for Linux and Mac OS X
        
        ```
        nearup run betanet
        ```
        
        Replace `betanet` with `testnet` if you want to use a different network.
        
        ### Using Locally Compiled Binary (recommended for security critical validators or development needs)
        
        Clone and compile nearcore with `make release` or `make debug` first.
        
        ```
        nearup run betanet --binary-path path/to/nearcore/target/{debug, release}
        ```
        
        Replace `betanet` with `testnet` if you want to use a different network.
        
        ## Spawn Local network
        
        Clone and compile nearcore with `make release` or `make debug` first.
        
        ```
        nearup run localnet --binary-path path/to/nearcore/target/{debug, release}
        ```
        
        By default it will spawn 4 nodes validating in 1 shard.
        RPC ports of each nodes will be consecutive starting from 3030.
        Access one node status using http://localhost:3030/status
        
        ## Stop a Running Node or all running nodes in local network
        
        ```
        nearup stop
        ```
        
        ## Additional Options
        
        ```
        nearup run betanet --help
        ```
        
        
        If the process is completed without errors, the node will be in sync within a few minutes.
        
        ### Cleaning up
        This is the step-by-step guide to remove nearup from your macOS system:
        
        1. Stop nearcore container
        	```
        	nearup stop
        	```
        	The output will be `Stopping docker near`
        
        2. Remove .near folder with the command
        	```
        	rm ~/-rf .near
        	```
