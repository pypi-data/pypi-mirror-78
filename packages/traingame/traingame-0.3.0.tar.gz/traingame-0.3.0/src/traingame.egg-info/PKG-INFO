        =========
        
        
        
        **traingame** is a 2D train racing game made for demonstrating AI applications. 
        The game is based on Laurens Koppenol' [Train-a-Train](https://github.com/lkoppenol/train-a-train) Repository, 
        With some additional tweaks to make it suitable for training Neural Networks. 
        This code includes some examples using NEAT: Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies.
