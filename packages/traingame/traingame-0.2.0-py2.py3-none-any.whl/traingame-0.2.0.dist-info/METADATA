**Train-a-Train** is a 2D train racing game made for demonstrating the simplest of AI applications. To use as in a workshop please check the *workshop* section in the documentation (see below).

Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn for questions or your high score!

This project was initially used for a workshop at ProRail, the Dutch rail infrastructure company. This explains the train ;)
