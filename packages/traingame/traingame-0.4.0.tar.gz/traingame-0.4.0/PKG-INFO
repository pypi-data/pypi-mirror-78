        =========
        
        
        
        **traingame** is a 2D train racing game made for demonstrating AI applications. 
        The game is based on Laurens Koppenol' [Train-a-Train](https://github.com/lkoppenol/train-a-train) Repository, 
        With some additional tweaks to make it suitable for training Neural Networks. 
        This code includes some examples using NEAT: Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies.

        This project was initially used for a workshop at ProRail, the Dutch rail infrastructure company. This explains the train ;)
        
        
        Warning
        -------
        
        This project is still Work in Progress. You could run into bugs when trying it out!
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Laurens documented his repository nicely. 
        I didn't, but you can still use his documentation to gain a fair bit of knowledge about the traingame library.
