#### **Supports**:
 - Reader supports .xlsx and .xlsm file extensions.
 - Writer only supports .xlsx (no macros/buttons/graphs/formatting) 

#### **Limitations**:
 - Does not support .xls (excel 97-2003 worksheet).
 - Does not support worksheet cell data more than 536,870,912 cells (32-bit list limitation).
 - Writer does not support anything other than writing values/formulas/strings.
 - Writing to existing workbooks will remove any macros/buttons/graphs/formatting!

#### **Why pylightxl over pandas/openpyxl/xlrd**

- **Zero non-standard library dependencies** 
  No compatibility/version control issues.

- **Light-weight single source code file that supports both Python3 and Python2.7.18.** 
  Single source files that can easily be copied directly into a project for true zero-dependency. 
  Great for those that have installation/download restrictions. 
  In addition the library's size and zero dependency makes this library pyinstaller compilation small and easy!

- **100% test-driven development for highest reliability/maintainability with 100% coverage on all supported versions**

- **API aimed to be user friendly and intuitive. Structure: database > worksheet > indexing example:**
   ``db.ws('Sheet1').index(row=1,col=2)``  or ``db.ws('Sheet1').address(address='B1')``

#### **Setup**
pylightxl is officially published on [pypi.org](pypi.org), however one of the
key features of pylightxl is that it is packed light in case the user has pip
and/or download restrictions, see [docs - installation](https://pylightxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

```pip install pylightxl```

---

#### **Future Tasks**
- additional database indexing features
- performance

#### **pypi version 1.45**
- added support for cell values that have multiple formats within a single cell.
  previous versions did not support this functionality since it is logged differently in sharedString.xml
- added support for updating formulas and viewing them:

    - view formula: ``db.ws('Sheet1').address('A1', formula=True)``
    - edit formula: ``db.ws('Sheet1').update_address('A1', val='=A1+10')``

- updated the following function arguments to drive commonality:

    - was: ``readxl(fn, sheetnames)`` new: ``readxl(fn, ws)``
    - was: ``writexl(db, path)`` new: ``writexl(db, fn)``
    - was: ``db.ws(sheetname)`` new: ``db.ws(ws)``
    - was: ``db.add_ws(sheetname, data)`` new: ``db.add_ws(ws, data)``

- added new feature to be able to read-in NamedRanges, store it in the Database, update it, remove it,
  and write it. NamedRanges were integrated with existing function to handle semi-structured-data

    - ``db.add_nr(name'range1', ws='sheet1', address='A1:C2')``
    - ``db.remove_nr(name='range1')``
    - ``db.nr_names``

- add feature to remove worksheet: ``db.remove_ws(ws='Sheet1')``
- add feature to rename worksheet: ``db.rename_ws(old='sh1', new='sh2')``
- added a cleanup function upon writing to delete _pylightxl_ temp folder in case an error left them
- added feature to write to file that is open by excel by appending a "new_" tag to the file name and
  a warning message that file is opened by excel so a file was saved as "new_" + filename
