      description: >
        The initial state of the LED. Valid values are LED_STATE_OFF (0),
        LED_STATE_ON (1), and LED_STATE_KEEP (2). If the LED is already on or
        off and the default-state property is set the to same value, then no
        glitch should be produced where the LED momentarily turns off (or on).
        The LED_STATE_KEEP setting will keep the LED at whatever its current
        state is, without producing a glitch. The default is LED_STATE_OFF (0)
        if this property is not present.
    led-pattern:
      required: false
      type: array
      description: Array of integers with default pattern for certain triggers.

      description: Retain the state of the LED in suspend state.
    retain-state-shutdown:
      required: false
      type: boolean
      description: Retain the state of the LED on shutdown.
    panic-indicator:
      required: false
      type: boolean
      description: The LED should be used as a panic indicator.
