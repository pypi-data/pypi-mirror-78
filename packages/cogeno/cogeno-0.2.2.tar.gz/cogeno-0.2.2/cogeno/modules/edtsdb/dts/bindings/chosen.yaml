    stdout-path:
        type: string
        required: false
        description: >
          Device to be used for boot console output
          If the character ":" is present in the value, this terminates the path.
          The meaning of any characters following the ":" is device-specific, and
          must be specified in the relevant binding documentation.
          For UART devices, the preferred binding is a string in the form:
            path:<baud>{<parity>{<bits>{<flow>}}}
          where
            path    - path of uart device
            baud	- baud rate in decimal
            parity	- 'n' (none), 'o', (odd) or 'e' (even)
            bits	- number of data bits
            flow	- 'r' (rts)
          For example: 115200n8r
