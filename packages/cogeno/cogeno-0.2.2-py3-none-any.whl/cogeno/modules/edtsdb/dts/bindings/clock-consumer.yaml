# -- Assigned clock parents and rates --
# Some platforms may require initial configuration of default parent clocks
# and clock frequencies. Such a configuration can be specified in a device tree
# node through assigned-clocks, assigned-clock-parents and assigned-clock-rates
# properties.

properties:
    clocks:
      required: true
      description: >
        List of phandle and clock specifier pairs, one pair for each clock
        input to the device. Note - if the clock provider specifies '0' for
        clock-cells, then only the phandle portion of the pair will appear.

    clock-names:
      required: false
      description: >
        List of clock input name strings sorted in the same order as the clocks
        property.

    clock-ranges:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: >
        Empty property indicating that child nodes can inherit named clocks from
        this node. Useful for bus nodes to provide a clock to their children.

    assigned-clocks:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: >
        List of phandle and clock specifier pairs, one pair for each assigned
        clock input. Note - if the clock provider specifies '0' for
        clock-cells, then only the phandle portion of the pair will appear.

    assigned-clock-parents:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: >
        List of parent clocks in the form of a phandle and clock
        specifier pair. The list shall correspond to the clocks listed in the
        assigned-clocks directive.

    assigned-clock-rates:
      type: array
      required: false
      description: >
        List of frequencies in Hz. The list shall correspond to the clocks
        listed in the assigned-clocks directive.
