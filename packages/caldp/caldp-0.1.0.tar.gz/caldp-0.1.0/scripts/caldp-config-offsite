# Configure CRDS for offsite use with a dynamic reference file cache.
#
# This is useful offsite when working on a small scale with a personal computer.
# Because this downloads CRDS files directly to a local cache,  once downloaded
# files are accessed from local disk rather than from VPN or the CRDS server,
# avoiding repeat downloads of potentially gigabytes of data.
#
# Since CRDS does check for updates with the CRDS server,   this configuration
# could eventually lead to scalability issues and probably would if run using
# arbitrary numbers of AWS virtual machines.
