   <h1>How To Buy Bitcoin?</h1>


   <p></p>


   <h4>What is Bitcoin?</h4>


   <p>Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or team who outlined the technology in a 2008 white
      paper. It’s an appealingly simple concept: <strong>bitcoin is digital money</strong> that allows for secure
      peer-to-peer transactions on the internet.
   </p>
   <p>Unlike services like Venmo and PayPal, which rely on the traditional financial system for permission to transfer
      money and on existing debit/credit accounts, bitcoin is decentralized: any two people, anywhere in the world, can
      send bitcoin to each other without the involvement of a bank, the government, or other institution.
      <p>
         Every transaction involving Bitcoin is tracked on the blockchain, which is similar to a bank ledger, or log of
         customers’ funds going in and out of the bank. In simple terms, it’s a record of every transaction ever made
         using bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
         There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. This is digital money that cannot be inflated or manipulated in any
         way.
      </p>
      <p>
         It isn’t necessary to buy an entire bitcoin: you can buy just a fraction of one if that’s all you want or need.
      </p>



      <h4>Why would I buy Bitcoin?</h4>


      <p>Bitcoin is in the news today more than ever. Thanks to skyrocketing prices and rollercoaster dips, everyone and
         their dogs are interested in learning how to buy and sell Bitcoin. As the most popular form of cryptocurrency,
         Bitcoin is now widely accepted around the world and has a growing number of applications. If you want to take
         advantage of that though, you first need to know how to buy Bitcoin and what to do with it when you have.
