Description: # torchph
        
        This repository contains [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) extensions to **compute**
        persistent homology and to **differentiate** through the persistent homology computation.
        The packaging structure is similar to PyTorch's structure to facilitate usage for people 
        familiar with PyTorch. 
        
        ## Documentation
        
        [Read the docs!](https://c-hofer.github.io/torchph/)
        
        The folder *tutorials* (within `docs`) contains some (more or less) minimalistic examples in form of Jupyter notebooks
        to demonstrate how to use the `PyTorch` extensions.

        If you use any of these extensions, please cite the following works (depending on which functionality you use, obviously :)
