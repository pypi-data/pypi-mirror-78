# PySh

A Python package that mimics the Oh-My-ZSH shell. This package creates a colorful ZSH prompt.

## Installation
> To install PySh onto your system, run `pip install python-pysh` in your terminal.

> If the command errors out, try `pip install git+git://github.com/Python3-8/python-pysh`.

> If the second command errors out too, clone the GitHub repo for PySh, move the `pysh` folder to  
your Python `site-packages` directory, copy the `pysh/pysh.py` file to your Python `bin` directory,  
rename the `pysh.py` file in your Python `bin` directory to `pysh`, and run `chmod +x <PYTHON_BIN_DIR>/pysh`  
in your terminal.

## Usage

The following command on your terminal will run the PySh shell.

```sh
$ pysh
```
