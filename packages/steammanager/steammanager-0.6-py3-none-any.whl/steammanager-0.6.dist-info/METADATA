# Steam Shortcut Manager

This is a script for adding non-steam shortcuts to Steam. Most of the work is done by the module [steamclient](https://gitlab.com/avalonparton/steam-client).

## Installation

The package is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/steamclient/) as `steammanager` and can be installed with pip.

```bash
pip install steammanager
```

## Usage

Point the script at your installed games with the `--directory` flag.

```
$ python -m steammanager --help                                    
usage: steammanager [-h] [--directory DIRECTORY] [--dry-run] [--clear-cache] [--vr] [--artwork] [--overwrite]

Manage Steam Shortcuts

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --directory DIRECTORY
                        location of installed game(s)
  --dry-run             don't write any changes
  --clear-cache         clears the app ID cache
  --vr                  sets VR flag for all games
  --artwork             gets official artwork from Steam
  --overwrite           overwrite existing artwork files
```

# Example Output
