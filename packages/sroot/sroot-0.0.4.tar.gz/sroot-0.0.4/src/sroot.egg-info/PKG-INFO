Description: # sroot
        
        sroot is a Python library for dealing with square root in radical form.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install sroot.
        
        ```bash
        pip install sroot
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import sroot
        print(sroot.sqrt([any integer]))
        
        ##It will provide you the square root in a radical form rather than decimal
        
        For eg. sroot.sqrt(8) gives 2v2 rather than 2.828427124 
        ```
