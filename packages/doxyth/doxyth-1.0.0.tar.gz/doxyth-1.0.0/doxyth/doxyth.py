class DoxyTH:
    """
    ### &doc_id doxyth:class

    Class that is made to be called by doxygen as a file pattern processor.

    This file (and class) is automatically called by Doxygen for it to process any file Doxygen encounters that follows
    the rule defined in the FILE_PATTERNS option of the config.
    By default, DoxyTH sets the FILE_PATTERNS value of the Doxygen config to "*py=.dthb", ".dthb" being the batch file
    called by Doxygen when it encounters any file ending by ".py".

    The batch file has "python -m doxyth.doxyth <lang> %1" as content. LANG is automatically changed by the gendoc class
    each time we change language. Doxygen then passes the file path, which is taken by the DoxyTH class as an input.

    The file is methodically read, and every doc_id matching the default regex pattern is registered, and then the whole
    doclines where the doc_id has been found are replaced by the linked documentation for this language.

    The file is then printed line per line for Doxygen to read it back and process it. If a postprocessing has been
    set upon running Gendoc, the file lines are instead sent to the postprocess (doxypy, doxypypy, etc.) which will
    take care of printing the line itself, after doing its job. The lines are sent through a class built for said
    postprocess, that acts as a bridge between what DoxyTH produced and what the postprocess requires.
