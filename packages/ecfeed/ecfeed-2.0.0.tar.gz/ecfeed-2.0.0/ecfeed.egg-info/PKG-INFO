        This library provides API to access ecfeed service from python code. Additionally it contains a command line 
        utility to access ecfeed from a console. 
        
        ## Introduction
        
        EcFeed online service provides REST API so that models defined in the online tool can be accessed 
        and used for test generation. Also tests that are generated in the online tool and stored in the 
        model can be downloaded and used for tests locally. This library provides user friendly way to access 
        the generated data from python code.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        EcFeed library is built and tested with Python 3.6, although it should work with earlier versions of Python 3. 
        It depends on pyopenssl and requests libraries.
