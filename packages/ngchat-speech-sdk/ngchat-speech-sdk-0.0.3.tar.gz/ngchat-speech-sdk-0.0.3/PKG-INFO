Description: # ngChat Speech to Text and Text to Speech SDK
        
        ## Next Generation Chat
        
        ### Welcome to ngChat, a revolutionary enterprise conversational platform that aims to:
        
        1. addressing issues from the first version of NLU/ChatFlow, and
        2. adding significant new features that support enterprise dialogue applications for the next 5 years.
        
        ### Our near term goals include:
        
        1. Make developing a chatbot more developer-friendly, e.g., including text-based version control and a DSL language for chatbot definition.
        2. Support multilingual on both backend (NLU) and frontend (UI).
        3. Construct a mature CI/CD pipeline for both in-the-cloud and on-premise deployment (separate or hybrid), also fix the previous errors of using both MongoDB and SQL.
        4. Add STT and TTS support, with connectors to Twilio's cloud communication platform.
