smmapdfs: Sudo make me a pdf sandwich
=====================================

smmapdfs is used for generating pdf files from django models by overlaying the text of fields onto a background pdf file. It differs from other django pdf apps such as `django-easy-pdf <https://django-easy-pdf.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.0-dev1/>`_ and `django-pdfkit <https://github.com/alexhayes/django-pdfkit>`_ in that it is intended to be used by graphics designers wishing to overlay some text onto a pre-prepaired pdf background.

smmapdfs can further be used to send out emails with the pdfs. It was initially intended to send out diplomas at the end of a cycling competition.
