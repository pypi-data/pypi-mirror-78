        # 31
        
        31 is a simple tool you can use to run code in the background on a server.
        
        For example
        
        ```
        31 -c 'sleep 100; echo 2'
        ```
        
        runs the command `sleep 100; echo 2` then sends you an email with the output of the command once it is complete.
        
        ## Setup
        
        Install 31 by running
        
        ```
        pip install 31
        ```
        
        Then set up your email address by running
        
        ```
        31 --config email youremail@example.com
        ```
        
        ### Quick dependency setup

        ### Detailed dependency setup
        
        #### Mail program
        
        By default, `31` searches for a mail program to use from the following list. You
        can also force it to use one of the programs by using the command
        
        ```
        31 --config mail_program <mail program name>
        ```
        
        - `gnu_mail`. To install on ubuntu you can run
        ```
        sudo apt install mailutils
        ```
        - `mutt`. To install on ubuntu you can run
        ```
        sudo apt install mutt
        ```
        
        #### Screen Manager
        
        Currently 31 only supports `screen`. To install screen on ubuntu run
        ```
        sudo apt install screen
        ```
