# About

`rename_musicfiles` is a very (!) simple script to rename musicfiles
by a hardcoded pattern from that file's Meta tags.  
This pattern is `<artist>/(-<year>-) albumname/<zero-padded track-nr> - <artist> - <track-name>.<file-extension>`.

This is how I need it for my personal preferences for years and it
is most certainly not applicable for anybody else.  
Do not install or use unless you share the same weird definition 
of tidiness as I do.
