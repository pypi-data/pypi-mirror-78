        Introduction
        ============
        
        This Readme gives a short overview over the available online
        documentation for rmtoo.
        
        Content
        =======
        
        This file contains the following chapters:
        
        .. contents:: Table of Contents
        
        
        Conventions
        ===========
        
        ``YY``
          names the version of rmtoo.  You have to replace this with the real
          version number.
        
        ``$ cmd``
          This is a command you have to type in.  The ``$`` is a replacement for
          the shell prompt - do not enter it as a part of the command.
        
        
        Operating System Support
        ========================
        
        rmtoo is fully supported under Linux.  Nevertheless, because it is
        written in computer independent programming languages (such as
        python), is also works on other operating systems.
        
        Mac OS X users might want to read ``Readme-OS-X.txt``.
        
        Windows users might want to read the ``Readme-Windows.txt``.
        
        
        Preinstalled VMs
        ================
        
        For evaluation proposes and running small projects there is the
        possibility to use Amazon AWS EC2 preinstalled VMs.
        
        More details are available in a dedicated Readme_.
        
        .. _Readme: contrib/vmsetup/Readme.rst
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The following sections assume, that you are using Linux.  Please
        refer to the appropriate Readme file for your operating system for
        more information if you do not use Linux.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        To use rmtoo, other software packages must be installed.
        
        rmtoo is written in python.  At least version 3.5 of python is needed.
        python 3.8 may work, but there is a problem (bug (fix)?) is python 3.8
        which create different XML elements as the previous versions.
        
        When you want to create LaTeX or PDF documentation, LaTeX is needed.
        
        For the requirements dependency graph, graphviz is used.
        
        For statistics plot gnuplot is used.  For the estimation module the
        python-scipy package is needed.
        
        Typically the packages from your distribution will work.
        
        First Project
        -------------
        
        The recommended way of starting is to copy the provided template
        project.
        
        The basic steps are:
        
        1) Copy over the template project to some other directory.
        2) Set up the environment
        3) Run ``make``
        4) Check, if everything worked
        5) Start changing / adapting things to your needs
        
        Note that during this document the project will be called
        'MyNewProject'.  Please adapt the name for your needs.
        
        
        Installation using virtualenv / pip
        ===================================
        
        This is the preferred installation method - it takes care that
        at least the python dependencies are correctly installed.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install ``rmtoo`` in a virtualenv, execute the following steps:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ mkdir RMTOO
           $ cd RMTOO
           $ virtualenv venv
           $ source venv/bin/activate
           $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
           $ pip install --only-binary=numpy,scipy numpy scipy
           $ pip install rmtoo
        
        This has only to be done once.
        
        First Project
        =============
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Change to a directory where you want to create the new project. This
        is needed only once.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           # cd to virtualenv directory - if not already there
           $ cd RMTOO
           $ cp -r venv/rmtoo/contrib/template_project MyNewProject
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To create all the artifacts for the template project, execute
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ cd MyNewProject
           $ source ./setenv.sh VENV
           $ make
           $ ls artifacts
        
        In the artifacts directory there are all the generated files.
        A typical workflow is, to change or add requirements, topics or the
        configuration in the ``MyNewProject`` directory, run ``make`` again
        and check the artifacts.
        
        Man Pages
        =========
        
        When using the virtualenv, use
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ man -l venv/rmtoo/share/man/man7/rmtoo.7
        
        to get an overview over all available man pages.
        Those other man pages you can read also with man. Replace the
        file name with the appropriate manual page, like:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ man -l venv/rmtoo/share/man/man7/rmtoo-analytics.7

        When using the tar package, emacs mode can be loaded in emacs by:
        ``M-x load-file``
        point to ``RMTOO/venv/rmtoo/contrib/req-mode.el``
        All files with suffix ``.req`` will now use the requirements editing
        mode.
