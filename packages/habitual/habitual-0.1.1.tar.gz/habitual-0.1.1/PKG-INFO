Description: ``habitual`` is a simple application to send reminders for things which
        are on a fixed, repeated schedule.
        
        You can tell ``habitual`` which application to use using ``--exec``. The
        default is ``notify-send``. The application should take one argument –
        the name of the reminder. If you need to pass more, create a wrapper
        script and call that. The default is ``notify-send``, but you may want
        to send to other services like `Pushbullet`_ or `Pushover`_, for
        example.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Reminders are is typically stored at ``~/.config/habitual/habitual``,
        and are automatically reloaded when the file is changed. The format is
        like so:
        
        ::
        
           cron|name
        
        For example, here’s how someone’s reminders might look:
        
        ::
        
           0 0 10-20 ? * * *|Drink water
           0 0 1 ? * * *|Start winding down
        
        .. _Pushbullet: https://www.pushbullet.com/
        .. _Pushover: https://pushover.net/
