* EAGER - Efficient Ancient GEnome Reconstruction (`website <https://eager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_; [Peltzer2016]_)

    EAGER provides an intuitive and user-friendly way for researchers to address two problems in current ancient genome reconstruction projects; firstly, EAGER allows users to efficiently preprocess, map and analyze ancient genomic data using a standardized general framework for small to larger genome reconstruction projects. Secondly, EAGER provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to run EAGER without needing to fully understand all the underlying technical details.
