.. _CombustionResiduals:

Combustion Residuals
====================
Combustion residuals are produced during thermal processing and may include bottom ash, fly ash, and APC residues.
APC residues may include excess lime, reaction products in wet scrubber sludge, activated carbon, and gypsum. In 
the US, fly ash and bottom ash are typically combined and disposed in a dedicated ash landfill or in an MSW landfill.

.. _FoodWaste:

Food Waste
==========
This material can remain in the mixed MSW and be landfilled or incinerated, or it can be separated and composted.
PFAS has not been measured directly in the organic fraction of MSW, but it has been found in both food packaging
and finished compost, so it would be expected to be in these composting feedstocks as well.

.. _Compost:

Compost
=======
Compost is produced in the composting process. High quality compost may be land applied, but compost is frequently
used in landfills as alternative daily cover. Landfilling of compost typically occurs because of high contamination
rates or a lack of local markets.
