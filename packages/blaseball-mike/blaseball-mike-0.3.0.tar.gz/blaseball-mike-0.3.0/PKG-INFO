Description: # blaseball-mike
        Totally not a microphone to the blaseball API
        
        This is a python wrapper over blaseball's public APIs, including player/team/game fetches, as well as deserialization of the event stream.
        
        # Installation
        
        `pip install blaseball-mike`
        
        
        # Usage
        ```
        >>> from blaseball_mike.models import Team
        >>> fridays = Team.load_by_name('fridays')
        >>> [player.name for player in fridays.lineup]
        ['Elijah Valenzuela', 'Juice Collins', 'York Silk', 'Baldwin Breadwinner', 'Terrell Bradley', 'Sixpack Dogwalker', 'Fletcher Yamamoto', 'Bevan Underbuck', 'Christian Combs']
        ```
        
        Nested objects will autoload when iterated over. Attributes match the names found in the official Blaseball API, just in snake case. Derived spec can be found here: https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/blaseball-api-spec
        
        Supported objects are:
        - Team
        - GlobalEvent
        - Player
        - Division
        - Subleague
        - League
        - Game
        
        
        # Development
        
        ```
        python3 -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
