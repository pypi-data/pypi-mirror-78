Transshipment problems form a subgroup of transportation problems, where 
transshipment is allowed. In transshipment, transportation may or must go 
through intermediate nodes, possibly changing modes of transport.

Transshipment or Transhipment is the shipment of goods or containers to an 
intermediate destination, and then from there to yet another destination. One 
possible reason is to change the means of transport during the journey (for 
example from ship transport to road transport), known as transloading. Another 
reason is to combine small shipments into a large shipment (consolidation), 
dividing the large shipment at the other end (deconsolidation). Transshipment 
usually takes place in transport hubs. Much international transshipment also 
takes place in designated customs areas, thus avoiding the need for customs 
checks or duties, otherwise a major hindrance for efficient transport.

    A deep gold mining operation is running at full speed.
    
    Problem:
    What schedule guarantees an optimal throughput given unpredictable output
    from the mines and unpredictable needs for mining equipment?
    
    Constraints:
    The gold mine has a surface depot which connects the 4 mining levels using
    an elevator running in the main vertical mine shaft.

    At each level there is a narrow gage electric train which can pull rail cars
    between the lift and side tracks where excavation occurs.

    Loading minerals and unloading equipment takes time, so the best way to
    avoid obstructing the busy lift is by moving the rail cars directly into
    the lift. However as mining equipment and valuable minerals are very heavy,
    the lift can only move one load at the time.

    Similarly the best way to avoid obstructing the railway at each level is by
    by moving the narrow gage rail cars onto side tracks that are available at
    each horizontal mine entry.

    Schematic of the mine:


        Mining shaft lift to surface depot.

        |
        +- level 2 <------------------->
        |              1  2  3  ... N

        |              1  2  3  ... N
        |
        +- level N

    In the intersection between the mining shaft lift and the electric
    locomotive there is limited space to perform any exchange, and because of
    constraints of the equipment, the order of delivery is strict:


       ^ towards surface.
