"""Grade is a combined library for grading C++ problem sets.

Grade is capable of testing three main aspects of C++ programs:
correctness, efficiency, and style. It includes tools for testing the
output of the code under various conditions, measuring its runtime
performance and memory usage, and running style checks.
