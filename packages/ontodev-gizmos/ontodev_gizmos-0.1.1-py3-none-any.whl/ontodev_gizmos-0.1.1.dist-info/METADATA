Utilities for ontology development

### Testing

For development, we recommend installing and testing using:
```
python3 -m pip install -e .
python3 setup.py pytest
```

There are some dependencies that are test-only (e.g., will not be listed in the project requirements). If you try and run `pytest` alone, it may fail due to missing dependencies.
