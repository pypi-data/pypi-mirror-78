            The project is still under heavy development. Feel free to open an issue if you encountered any.
            I appreciate any feedback in order to improve the package ;)
        
        Motivation & Goal
        ------------------
        
        The goal of the project is to provide machine learning for **everyone**, both technical and non technical
        users.
        
        I needed a tool sometimes, which I can use to fast create a machine learning prototype. Whether to build
        some proof of concept or create a fast draft model to prove a point. I find myself often stuck at writing
        boilerplate code and/or thinking too much of how to start this.
        
        Therefore, I decided to create **igel**. Hopefully, it will make it easier for technical and non technical
        users to build machine learning models.
        
        Intro
        --------
        
        igel is built on top of scikit-learn. It provides a simple way to use machine learning without writing
        a **single line of code**
        
        All you need is a yaml file, where you need to describe what you are trying to do. That's it!
        
        Installation
        -------------
        
        - The easiest way is to install igel using `pip <https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/>`_
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install igel
        
        - Check the docs for other ways to install igel from source
        
        Quick Start
        ------------
        
        - First step is to provide a yaml file:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
                # model definition
                model:
                    # in the type field, you can write the type of problem you want to solve. Whether regression or classification
                    # Then, provide the algorithm you want to use on the data. Here I'm using the random forest algorithm
                    type: regression
                    algorithm: random forest
        
                # target you want to predict
                # Here, as an example, I'm using a dataset, where I want to predict the GPA values.
                # Depending on your data, you need to provide the target(s) you want to predict here
                target:
                    - GPA
        
        In the example above, we declare that we have a regression
        problem and we want to use the random forest model
        to solve it. Furthermore, the target we want to
        predict is GPA (since I'm using this simple `dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/luddarell/101-simple-linear-regressioncsv>`_ )
        `
        - Run this command in Terminal, where you provide the **path to your dataset** and the **path to the yaml file**
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ igel fit --data_path 'path_to_your_csv_dataset.csv' --yaml_file 'path_to_your_yaml_file.yaml'
        
            # or shorter
            $ igel fit -dp 'path_to_your_csv_dataset.csv' -yml 'path_to_your_yaml_file.yaml'
        
        
        you can run this command to get instruction on how to use the model:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ igel -h
        
        
        That's it. Your "trained" model can be now found in the model_results folder
        (automatically created for you in your current working directory).
        Furthermore, a description can be found in the description.json file inside the model_results folder.
        
        Examples
        ----------
        Check the examples folder, where you can use the csv data to run a simple example from terminal
        
        TODO
        -----
        - add option as arguments to the models
        - add multiple file support
        - provide an api to evaluate models
