- Updated JS_INIT block to match jQuery File Upload demonstration 
    (as of 17-07-2013) 
- Removed the JS_FORM block; this will resolve the JavaScript Uncaught
  TypeError thrown for the deprecated jQuery '.live' method.
- The file deletion template now accounts for CSRF token expected by Django.
- Added the Glyphicons found in the jQuery File Upload demonstration.
