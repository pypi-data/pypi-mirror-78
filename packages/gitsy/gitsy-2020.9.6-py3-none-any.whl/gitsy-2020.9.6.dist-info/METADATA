# Gitsy - Git made easy!

| NOTICE: gitsy is still very much under construction, I'll notify when a standard beta version is ready. |
| --- |

Gitsy is a supplementary CLI to git for a better git flow and git experience.

I started it to enhance my git productivity and answer 4 main use cases:
1. Fast commits - a combination of git's add, commit and push. 
2. Undo changes - easily undo all changes made to a file, whether it was staged or unstaged.
3. Easy branch hopping - move between branches, even if you have unstaged changes, without having to stage them.
4. Simplify git ignore resetting - that annoying thing where you accidentally pushed something you wanted ignored. 

Other then that I've added some interactiveness to the git flow - selectors, checkboxes, prompts, etc.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install gitsy
```

## Usage
gitsy can be used in a globaly with no context (out-of-the-box) or in a branch context.

### No context:

```bash
# git add .
# git commit -m "commit message"
# git push 

# IS NOW:
gitsy up "commit message" 

# Notes:
# - Commit message is optional (defaulted to 'fast commit').
# - Auto handles the case of setting remote origin for new branches.
```

```bash
# To undo changes in an unstaged changed file:
gitsy undo file_1.py 
# To pick a file just drop the file's name:
gitsy undo
```

```bash

# for staged files use:
gitsy regret

# ...
