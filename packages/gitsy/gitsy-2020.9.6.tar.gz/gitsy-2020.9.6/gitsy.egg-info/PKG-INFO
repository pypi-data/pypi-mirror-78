        # Gitsy - Git made easy!
        
        | NOTICE: gitsy is still very much under construction, I'll notify when a standard beta version is ready. |
        | --- |
        
        Gitsy is a supplementary CLI to git for a better git flow and git experience.
        
        I started it to enhance my git productivity and answer 4 main use cases:
        1. Fast commits - a combination of git's add, commit and push. 
        2. Undo changes - easily undo all changes made to a file, whether it was staged or unstaged.
        3. Easy branch hopping - move between branches, even if you have unstaged changes, without having to stage them.
        4. Simplify git ignore resetting - that annoying thing where you accidentally pushed something you wanted ignored. 
        
        Other then that I've added some interactiveness to the git flow - selectors, checkboxes, prompts, etc.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.
        
        ```bash
        pip install gitsy
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        gitsy can be used in a globaly with no context (out-of-the-box) or in a branch context.
        
        ### No context:
        
        ```bash
        # git add .
        # git commit -m "commit message"
        # git push 
        
        # IS NOW:
        gitsy up "commit message" 
        
        # Notes:
        # - Commit message is optional (defaulted to 'fast commit').
        # - Auto handles the case of setting remote origin for new branches.
        ```
        ![Alt text](examples/images/gitsy_up.png?raw=true "Title")
        ```bash
        # To undo changes in an unstaged changed file:
        gitsy undo file_1.py 
        # To pick a file just drop the file's name:
        gitsy undo
        ```
        ![Alt text](examples/images/gitsy_undo.png?raw=true "Title")
        ```bash
        
        # for staged files use:
        gitsy regret
        
        # ... 
        ```
