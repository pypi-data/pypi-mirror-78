# our parameters
Parameters:
- name: courselevels.create_menubar_buttons
  description: >
    when publishing a course we need the levels/colors to be displayed, but
    the 3 icons on top for actually changing levels/colors are 
    a hindrance
  input_type: checkbox
  default: yes
- name: courselevels.define_keyboard_shortcuts
  description: >
    the extension comes with 3 jupyter actions, one for toggling each level,
    that can be bound to keyboard shortcuts in your `custom.js`;
    by default these actions are not bound to any keyboard shortcuts,
    as it is of interest to authors mostly; 
    if you enable this option, they will be bound to control-x, control-y 
    and control-z respectively for basic, intermediate and advanced levels;
    beware that control-z was a poor choice on windows/linux
