A Python tool for building static, templated blogs with Markdown.

Check out a more humanized introduction to Ochs in my [blog post](https://vsartor.com/blogging_in_python.html).

A proper README documenting the main feature of the tool is still in the works, so for now that blog is all I have to offer! Come back in a few days otherwise ðŸ˜‰
