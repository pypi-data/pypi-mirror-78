!Properties from TestCase_0 that are present in this test case:
! - no matrix A
! - only bin vars on the first stage
! - standard bounds for 1st stage cont vars (if any)
! - only vector rhs is stochastic

!Properties specific for this TestCase:
! all scenarios have the same RHS
! integer vars on the 2nd stage

!These properties of are present in all TestCases:
! - MIN obj - always the case for smps files
! - 2 stages - only such problems are in scope of the research
! - only cont vars on the 2nd stage - we will solve the relaxation otherwise
! - >= constraints in subproblems - we do not care about subproblems
! - bin and cont (if any) vars on the first - int vars are prohibited

! Solution value: -17600
! Solution value 2nd stage relaxation: -17600.4
! Solution value all stages relaxation: -17900.1
