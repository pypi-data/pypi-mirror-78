Description: The Pandeia engine is a 'simulation-hybrid' exposure time calculation engine that performs calculations on two-dimensional astronomical scenes created by the user. It uses a pixel-based 3D approach, modeling both the spatial and wavelength dimensions using realistic PSFs for each instrument mode, and handles saturation, correlated read noise, and inter-pixel capacitance. It supports both the James Webb Space Telescope and the Wide-field Imager mode of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.
