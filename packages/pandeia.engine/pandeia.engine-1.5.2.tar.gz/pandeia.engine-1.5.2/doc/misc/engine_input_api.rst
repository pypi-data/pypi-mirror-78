background:
    string for notional background lookup, or see below

configuration:
    dict: camera/telescope configuration

scene:
    list: list of sources

strategy:
    dict: strategy configuration


calculation:
    dict: test interface

fake_exception:
    test interface

error, server_test:
    reserved by server


Details of Inputs for ETC Calculation
=====================================

NOTE - keep all of the following in synch with: pandeia/engine/helpers/schema

As of now, the engine requires the following information to perform a
calculation:

scene: list (no default)
  This is a list of Sources. Each Source is described by a dict with
  the following keys:

    position: dict
      Source position parameters described by the following keys:

        x_offset: float (default 0.0)
            Detector plane X offset from FOV center in arcseconds. Positive to the right.
        y_offset: float (default 0.0)
            Detector plane Y offset from FOV center in arcseconds. Positive is up.
        orientation: float (default 0.0)
            Detector plane orientation in degrees. Positive is in direction of +X.
            (e.g. orientation=90 is UP, and orientation=-90 is DOWN)

    shape: dict
      Source shape parameters described by the following keys:

        geometry: string (default "point")
            Supported geometries are "point", "gaussian2d", "flat", and "sersic". Required
            additional source shape parameters are contingent on this parameter:

                "point" requires no additional parameters.

                "gaussian2d", "flat", and "sersic" all require these parameters:
                    major: float (default 0.1)
                        Semi-major axis in arcseconds. For "flat" this sets the size, for "gaussian2d"
                        this sets the sigma, and for "sersic" this sets a scale length where
                        I(r) = I(0)/e.
                    minor: float (default 0.1)
                        Semi-minor axis in arcseconds

                "sersic" requires one additional parameter:
                    sersic_index: float (default 1.0)
                        Power law index that sets the shape of a sersic profile.
                        sersic_index = 1.0 --> exponential
                        sersic_index = 0.5 --> gaussian
                        sersic_index = 4.0 --> de Vaucouleurs

    spectrum: dict
      Source spectral parameters described by the following keys:

        redshift: float (default 0.0)
            Redshift to apply to the continuum. Since lines are added with physical units for their strength,
            they are added to the spectrum after normalization and redshift.

            X and Y center position of the aperture and sky annulus.
        background_subtraction: boolean
            Choose to use background subtraction or not

    The parameters required for **tacentroid** are:

    The parameters required for the planned methods will be defined as the methods
    are implemented.

fake_exception: list of strings
    If present, this list is searched for control terms that cause
    perform_calculation to raise exceptions for testing purposes.
    Currently recognized strings are:

        'pandeia':
             raise PandeiaException

        'exception':
             raise Exception

    Other strings may be added later to add exceptions or modify
    the details of the exception objects raised.
