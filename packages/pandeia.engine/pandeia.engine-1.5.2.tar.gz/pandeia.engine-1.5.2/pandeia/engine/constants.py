# Pandeia subsamples lines in order to accurately reproduce thin spectral lines in a spectrum. This subsampling must
# extend over a large enough range to contain most of the wings and accurately reproduce the line.
#
# spectral_line_window determines the size of the wavelength window over which lines are subsampled. Values above 15
#  (decided empirically, see Issue #3292) are necessary to contain the wings of the line.
# spectral_line_subsample determines how much the spectrum is subsampled within the window to reproduce the shape of
#  the profile.

# In practice, a value of 200 samples within an imaging configuration's wavelength range (i.e. filter bandpass) should
# be more than enough to produce an accurate image. Note that because we use synphot to resample, even the flux of
# narrow lines is conserved.

# Pandeia's spectrum processing can use a considerable amount of memory for large fields (like SOSS). To handle this,
# we divide the spectra into chunks of wavelength planes (if necessary) at the cost of a few seconds of run time. There
# may be a more elegant way to handle this...

# created if any of the pixels are too bright - even getting close to the maximum floating point number that can be

# pixel to the value at the exact center. Instead, we need to oversample that pixel and compute a more accurate flux for
# the central pixel of the sersic. The process by which the number 101 was arrived at can be found here:
