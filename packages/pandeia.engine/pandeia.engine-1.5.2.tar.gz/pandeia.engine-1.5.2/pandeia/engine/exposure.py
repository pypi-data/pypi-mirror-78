        Create a Target Acquisition Exposure Specification.

        Inputs
        ------
        pattern: str
            name of readout pattern

        ngroup: int
            number of groups per integration

        ngroup_extrac: int
            number of groups actually used by the TA script (it ignores most of them). 3 is a
            common value. Note that this has to be <ngroup.

        nint: int
            number of integrations per exposure

        nexp: int
            number of exposures

        tframe: float
            number of seconds per frame

        nframe: int (optional, default 1)
            number of frames per group

        nsample: int (optional, default 1)
            number of samples averaged while reading a single pixel.
            Used by MIR detectors.

        nsample_skip: int (optional, default 0)
            number of samples skipped while reading a single pixel.
            Used by MIR detectors.

        subarray: str (optional, default 'Full')
            name of subarray to be read.
            If None, readout is full frame

        nskip: int (optional, default 0)
            number of skipped frames per group. Only
            supported by some readout patterns.

        nprerej: int (optional, default 0)
            The MIR detectors (i.e. MIRI) reject the first and last reads of a ramp (and maybe more eventually).
            For checking saturation, we need to handle them separately.  We need to account for signal accrued
            during frames rejected before the ramp, but don't care about the signal afterwards.

        npostrej: int (optional, default 0)
            Frames rejected after a ramp don't count towards saturation time, but need to be included in total exposure time.

        frame0: bool (optional, default False)
            Some instruments can downlink the frame0 read. Set to True if frame0 is used in the ramp fit.

        det_type: string (optional, default 'h2rg')
            Detector type, timing calculation is dependent on detector type
