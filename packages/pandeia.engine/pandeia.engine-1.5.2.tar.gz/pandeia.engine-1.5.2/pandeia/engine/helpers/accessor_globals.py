These globals were refactored from the top of the straylight accessor because
some of them are also used by the thermal accessor.

In principle, this wavelist should be identical (ideally, read from) the standard
wavelength set delivered with the BMG in bgmodel/inputs/std_spectrum_wavelengths.txt.

In practice, it must be identical to the waveset used BACK WHEN the cached data was
generated by other code in the straylight area of the BMG svn repo.

Note that the comment above, which describes the structure of that file, refers to [SL_NWAVE].
