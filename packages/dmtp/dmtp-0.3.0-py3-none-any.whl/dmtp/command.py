    Commands
    ~~~~~~~~
    
    WHO
        Ask the receiver 'Who are you?' for user ID. The receiver should respond
        a 'HI' command with user ID.

        send back to the server for login.

        Fields:
            ID - current user's identifier
            ADDR - current user's public IP and port (OPTIONAL)
            TIME - current time (OPTIONAL)
            S - signature of 'ADDR+TIME' (OPTIONAL)
            NAT - current user's NAT type (OPTIONAL)

    SIGN
        Server-Client command: respond the user's MAPPED-ADDRESS to ask signing.

        Fields:
            ID - user identifier
            ADDR - user's public IP and port

    CALL
        Client-Server command: ask the server to help connecting with someone.

        Field:
            ID - contact identifier

    FROM

        When the server received a 'CALL' command from user(A), it will check
        whether another user(B) being called is online,
        if YES, send a 'FROM' command to user(B) with the user(A)'s location,
        at the same time, respond to user(A) with the user(B)'s location;
        if NO, respond an empty 'FROM' command with only one field 'ID'.

        Fields:
            ID - user identifier
            ADDR - user's public IP and port (OPTIONAL)
            TIME - signed time (OPTIONAL)
            S - signature of 'ADDR+TIME' signed by this user (OPTIONAL)
            NAT - user's NAT type (OPTIONAL)

    BYE
        When a client is offline, send this command to the server, or broadcast
        this command to every contacts to logout.

        Fields:
            ID - user identifier
            ADDR - user's public IP and port
            TIME - signed time
            S - signature of 'ADDR+TIME' signed by this user
            NAT - user's NAT type (OPTIONAL)
