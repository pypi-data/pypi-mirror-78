Description: py3adf
        ======
        
        `py3adf` is a port of David Boddie's `ADF2INF` ADFS image reading tool and its
        supporting `ADFSlib` library module. The original versions can be found,
        alongside many other nice things, in the [Acorn-Format-Tools][] repository.
        
        The primary goal of this fork is to provide a version of `ADF2INF` that runs on
        Python 3.
        
        Additional goals include:
        
         - Minor enhancements for `ADF2INF`.
         - `pip` packaging, with support for running `ADF2INF` easily on Windows.
         - Tasteful use of new language features.
         - Increased type safety with type hints and explicit casts (where essential).
         - Automated acceptance tests.
