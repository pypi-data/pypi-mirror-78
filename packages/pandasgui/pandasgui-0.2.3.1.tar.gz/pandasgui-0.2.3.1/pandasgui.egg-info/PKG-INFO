        ## Installation
        
        Install latest release from PyPi:
        
        ```shell
        pip install pandasgui
        ```
        
        Install directly from Github for the latest unreleased changes:
        
        ```shell
        pip install git+https://github.com/adamerose/pandasgui.git
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Create and view a simple DataFrame
        
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        from pandasgui import show
        
        df = pd.DataFrame(([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]), columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])
        show(df)
        ```
        
        Or if you are running your code as a script instead of within iPython, you will need to block execution until you close the GUI
        
        ```python
        show(df, settings={'block': True})
        ```
        
        PandasGUI comes with sample datasets that will automatically download on first usage
        
        ```python
        from pandasgui import show
        from pandasgui.datasets import pokemon, titanic
        show(pokemon, titanic)
        ```
        
        This module also exports `all_datasets` which is a dictionary of all the sample datasets
        
        ```python
        from pandasgui import show
        from pandasgui.datasets import all_datasets
        show(**all_datasets)
        ```
        
        ## Features
