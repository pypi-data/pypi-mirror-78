Thumbnailer: A Plugin for Pelican
=================================

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/pelican-plugins/thumbnailer/build)](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/thumbnailer/actions) [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pelican-thumbnailer)](https://pypi.org/project/pelican-thumbnailer/)

Thumbnailer is a Pelican plugin that creates thumbnails for all of the images found under a specific directory, in various thumbnail sizes.


Installation
-------------

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-thumbnailer

[Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) will be automatically installed in order to resize the images, and the thumbnail will only be re-built if it doesn't already exist (to save processing time). Depending on your local environment and your image types, you may need to also install [external libraries](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#external-libraries) to add support for certain image file formats.


Configuration
-------------

* `IMAGE_PATH` is the path to the image directory. It should reside inside your content directory, and defaults to `pictures`.
* `THUMBNAIL_DIR` is the path to the output sub-directory where the thumbnails are generated.
* `THUMBNAIL_SIZES` is a dictionary mapping size name to size specifications.
  The generated filename will be `originalname_thumbnailname.ext` unless `THUMBNAIL_KEEP_NAME` is set.
* `THUMBNAIL_KEEP_NAME` is a Boolean that, if set, puts the file with the original name in a `thumbnailname` folder, named like the key in `THUMBNAIL_SIZES`.
* `THUMBNAIL_KEEP_TREE` is a Boolean that, if set, saves the image directory tree.
* `THUMBNAIL_INCLUDE_REGEX` is an optional string that is used as regular expression to restrict thumbnailing to matching files. By default all files not starting with a dot are respected.

Sizes can be specified using any of the following formats:

* `wxh` will resize to exactly `wxh` cropping as necessary to get that size
* `wx?` will resize so that the width is the specified size, and the height will scale to retain aspect ratio
* `?xh` same as `wx?` but will height being a set size
* `s` is a shorthand for `wxh` where `w=h`
