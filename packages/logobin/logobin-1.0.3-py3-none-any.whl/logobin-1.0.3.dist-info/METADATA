## logobin  
===
A simple command line utility for working with logo.bin files for Android head units based on the ac8227l SoC.  
=  
This utility is made to simplify the process of extracting the MediaTek header from a logo.bin file or adding it 
to an image file you want to use as your boot screen.  All the units I've seen need a 1024x600 pixel bitmap image
in 8-bit RGB color.

Help is available from the command line with the -h or --help option, but basic usage is as follows:  

	-c (file)             Test a file for the presence of a valid header.
	-u (logo.bin file)    Unpack logo.bin to a header and image file.
	-p [(header file) (image file) (optional: filename)]
							Pack header and image into a flashable binfile.If not given, filename defaults to
							logo.bin

Using logobin as a module:  
==  
If you'd like to use this script as a module in some other code, it exposes the following methods:  

>check(these_bytes):		*Accepts a list of bytes as input, and tests to see if they start with a valid header.*
>logo_bin_pack(header, bmp, filename):	*Accepts an MTK header, a bitmap file and an optional output filename as input.   Packs a logo.bin file.   If not given, filename defaults to logo.bin*  
>logo_bin_unpack(binfile):	*Accepts a logo.bin with a valid MTK header as input, and unpacks it, producing header.bin and logo.bmp*
