Description: Description
        -----------
        
        ``cplay`` is a minimalist music player with a textual user interface
        written in Python. It aims to provide a power-user-friendly interface
        with simple filelist and playlist control.
        
        Instead of building an elaborate database of your music library,
        ``cplay`` allows you to quickly browse the filesystem and enqueue
        files, directories, and playlists.
        
        The original cplay was started by Ulf Betlehem in 1998 and is no longer
        maintained.  This is a rewrite that aims to stay true to the original design
        while evolving with a shifting environment.
