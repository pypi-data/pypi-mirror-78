    images can be linked easily
    rename them as the gateway choices and use them as below
    if your checkout page contains payment selection based on images

{% endcomment %}

{% for choice in gateway_choices %}
    <input type="radio" name="gateway_code" value="{{ choice.0 }}"> {{ choice.1 }}<br>
    <img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}knpay_plugin/images/{{ choice.0 }}.jpg" alt="{{ choice.1 }}">
{% endfor %}
