        # Zoho CRM API
        This API is for people who are having trouble with the official Zoho API. 
        
        * Supports Zoho API v2
        
        So far this package supports the following Record API actions:
        
        | Module          | Create | Retrieve | Update | Delete |
        |-----------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|

        ## Installation
        
        You can install from pip:
        ```
        $ pip install zohocrmapi
        ```
        
        Or from Github:
        
        ```
        $ cd <python-project-folder>
        $ git clone https://github.com/backupbrain/zoho-crm-api
        $ ln -s zoho-crm-api/zohocrm zohocrm
        $ pip install -r zoho-crm-api/requirements.txt  # install requirements
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Set-up
        
        1) Log in to [api-console.zoho.com](https://api-console.zoho.com)
        2) Click "Add Client"
        3) Select "Self-Client"
        4) Select your new "Self-Client" and generate a new grant token with your [desired scopes](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/oauth-overview.html#scopes)
        5) Copy that grant token
        
        ### Log-in 
        
        
        ```python
        from zohocrm import ZohoCRMRestClient
        
        client_id = '<paste your Zoho client id>'
        client_secret = '<paste your Zoho client secret>'
        redirect_uri = '<paste your Redirect URL>'
        grant_token = '<paste your newly created token>'
        zohoclient = ZohoCRMRestClient(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
        
        #  generate your oauth token
        oauth_access_token = zohoclient.generate_access_token(grant_token)
        
        # returns a ZohoCRMOAuthToken instance:
        '''
        ZohoCRMOAuthToken({
            "access_token": "<access_token>",
            "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>",
            "api_domain": "https://www.zohoapis.com",
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "expiry_timestamp": <expiration timestamp float>
        })
        '''
        
        # oauth_access_token.refresh_token is used to refresh the token
        # oauth_access_token.access_token is used to authorize future interacitons with the API
        # oauth_access_token.is_expired() returns true when the token has expired
        ```
        
        The `oauth_access_token` is saved for future use, for instance for accessing restricted areas of the API or for refreshing the OAuth token.
        
        In cases where the OAuth  token must be loaded manually, for instance in a cron job that asks to refresh the token, the ZohoCRMOAuthToken can be loaded manually:
        
        ```python
        from zohocrm import ZohoCRMRestClient, ZohoCRMOAuthToken
        
        zohoclient = ZohoCRMRestClient(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
        zohoclient.oauth_access_token = ZohoCRMOAuthToken({
            "access_token": "<access_token>",
            "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>",
            "api_domain": "https://www.zohoapis.com",
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "expiry_timestamp": <expiration_timestamp_float>
        })
        ```
        
        ### Refresh 
        
        Zoho access tokens are valid for 60 minutes, so they must be  refreshed periodically. This can be done manually or in a thread or a cron.
        
        ```python
        # ...
        #  refresh your oauth token
        oauth_refresh_token = zohoclient.generate_refresh_token()
        
        # returns a ZohoCRMOAuthToken instance:
        '''
        ZohoCRMOAuthToken({
            "access_token": "<access_token>",
            "api_domain": "https://www.zohoapis.com",
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "expiry_timestamp": <expiration timestamp float>
        })
        '''
        # oauth_refresh_token.access_token is used to authorize future interacitons with the API
        # oauth_refresh_token.is_expired() returns true when the token has expired
        ```
        
        The `oauth_refresh_token` is saved for future use, for instance for accessing restricted areas of the API or for refreshing the OAuth token.
        
        In cases where the OAuth  token must be loaded manually, for instance in a cron job that asks to refresh the token, the both the `.oauth_access_token` and `.oauth_refresh_token` must be loaded manually, because:
        * the `.oauth_access_token` contains the `.refresh_token`, required for refreshing the OAuth token:
        * the `.oauth_refresh_token` contains  the latest  `.access_token` generated by the Zoho API, required for accessing restricted areos of the API.
        
        
        ```python
        from zohocrm import ZohoCRMRestClient, ZohoCRMOAuthToken
        
        zohoclient = ZohoCRMRestClient(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
        zohoclient.oauth_access_token = ZohoCRMOAuthToken({
            "access_token": "<access_token>",
            "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>",
            "api_domain": "https://www.zohoapis.com",
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "expiry_timestamp": <expiration_timestamp_float>
        })
        
        zohoclient.oauth_refresh_token = ZohoCRMOAuthToken({
            "access_token": "<access_token>",
            "api_domain": "https://www.zohoapis.com",
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "expiry_timestamp": <expiration_timestamp_float>
        })
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        from zohocrm import ZohoCRMRestClient, ZohoCRMOAuthToken
        
        zohoclient = ZohoCRMRestClient(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
        zohoclient.oauth_access_token = ZohoCRMOAuthToken({
            "access_token": "<access_token>",
            "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>",
            "api_domain": "https://www.zohoapis.com",
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "expiry_timestamp": <expiration_timestamp_float>
        })
        ```
        
        ### The ZohoCRMOAuthToken Object
        
        When you create or refresh an oauth_token, the `ZohoCRMRestClient` will return a `ZohoCRMOAuthToken` instance.
        
        The `ZohoCRMOAuthToken` contains:
        * an `.access_token`, which is used to authorize API access
        * `.is_expired()`, which returns `True` if the access token is expired
        
        If the  `ZohoCRMOAuthToken` was created with the `zohoclient.generate_access_token` method, it will also contain:
        * `.refresh_token`, which must be used for all future token refresh requests using the `zohoclient.generate_refresh_token()` method.
        
        ### Changing the Base URL
        
        By default, the `ZohoCRMRestClient` connects to the `https://www.zohoapis.com` data center. This can be changed by setting the `.api_base_url` property:
        
        ```python
        zohoclient = ZohoCRMRestClient()
        zohoclient.api_base_url = 'https://accounts.zoho.eu'  # EU data center
        ```
        
        [Zoho data center options can be viewed here.](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/multi-dc.html)
        
        
        ### Working with Contacts
        
        Import the `ZohoCRMContact` module
        
        ```python
        from zohocrm import ZohoCRMContact
        ```
        
        Zoho converts the module's field such that:
        * Spaces are replaced with underscores and 
        * The capitalization of each word is preserved
        
        For example, the field "First Name" becomes `.First_Name`
        
        For this reason, you can get and set the fields of a `ZohoCRMContact` like this:
        
        ```python
        contact.First_Name = "John"
        contact.Last_Name = "Doe"
        contact.Email = "email@example.com"
        ```
        
        #### Retrieve a contact
        
        ```python
        contact_id = 1234023423424
        contact = ZohoCRMContact.fetch(
            zohoclient,
            contact_id
        )
        
        print(lead.First_Name)
        ```
        
        #### Insert or Update a Contact
        
        ```python
        owner = {
            'id': 1234234234,
            'name': "<Your user's name>",
            'email': "<Your user's email>"
        }
        contact = ZohoCRMContact(zohoclient)
        contact.First_Name = 'John'
        contact.Last_Name = 'Doe'
        contact.Title = 'Job title'
        contact.Company = 'Programming'
        contact.Industry = 'San Francisco'
        contact.State = 'CA'
        contact.Country = 'United States'
        contact.ZIP_Code = '94110'
        contact.Website = 'http://example.com'
        contact.Owner = owner
        
        # if contact.id is set, .save() will update
        # if contact.id is not set, .save() will insert
        contact.save()
        
        print(contact.id)
        ```
        
        #### Delete a Contact
        
        You can delete a contact with or without retrieving it first.
        
        If the contact has already  been retrieved, the `.delete()` method will delete the record with the matching `.id`:
        
        ```python
        contact_id = 1234023423424
        contact = ZohoCRMContact.fetch(
            zohoclient,
            contact_id
        )
        
        # Delete
        contact.delete()
        ```
        
        If the contact has not yet been retrieved, the `.delete_id()` requires the `id` of the record and can be called from the static class:
        
        ```python
        contact_id = 1234023423424
        contact = ZohoCRMContact.delete_id(
            zohoclient,
            contact_id
        )
        ```
        
        
        ### Working with Vendors
        
        Import the `ZohoCRMVendor` module
        
        ```python
        from zohocrm import ZohoCRMVendor
        ```
        
        #### Retrieve a Vendor
        
        ```python
        vendor_id = 1234023423424
        vendor = ZohoCRMVendor.fetch(
            zohoclient,
            vendor_id
        )
        
        print(lead.Name)
        ```
        
        #### Insert or Update a Vendor
        
        Inserting  and updating a `ZohoCRMVendor` is the  same as with a `ZohoCRMContact`,  but with Vendor data instead of Contact data.
        
        
        #### Delete a Vendor
        
        You can delete a vendor with or without retrieving it first.
        
        If the lead has already been retrieved, the `.delete()` method will delete the record with the matching `.id`:
        
        ```python
        vendor_id = 1234023423424
        vendor = ZohoCRMVendor.fetch(
            zohoclient,
            vendor_id
        )
        
        # Delete
        vendor.delete()
        ```
        
        If the vendor has not yet been retrieved, the `.delete_id()` requires the `id` of the record and can be called from the static class:
        
        ```python
        vendor_id = 1234023423424
        vendor = ZohoCRMVendor.delete_id(
            zohoclient,
            vendor_id
        )
        ```
        
        ### Working with Leads
        
        Import the `ZohoCRMLead` module
        
        ```python
        from zohocrm import ZohoCRMLead
        ```
        
        #### Retrieve a Lead
        
        ```python
        lead_id = 1234023423424
        lead = ZohoCRMLead.fetch(
            zohoclient,
            lead_id
        )
        ```
        
        #### Insert or Update a Lead
        
        Inserting and updating a `ZohoCRMLead` is the same as with a `ZohoCRMContact`,  but with Lead data instead of Contact data.
        
        #### Delete a Lead
        
        Deleting a `ZohoCRMLead` is the same as with a `ZohoCRMContact`,  but with Lead data instead of Contact data.
        
        ### Other modules
        
        The API interface is the same for all [Zoho Records](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/get-records.html).
        
        ### Custom modules
        
        Zoho CRM provides the ability to create custom modules. This API works within that framework to allow you to create, retrieve, update, and delete custom module records.
        
        Let's say you have a custom module called `Friends` which has the following structure:
        * Friend Owner
        * First Name
        * Last Name
        * Email
        * Favorite Color
        
        You can create an object that talks to this module by creating a class that extends `ZohoCRMRecord` with a `_module_name` property equal to the [module's API Name](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/modules-api.html#:~:text=Zoho%20CRM%20generates%20API%20name,%2C%20fields%2C%20and%20related%20lists.).
        
        ```python
        from zohocrm import ZohoCRMRecord
        
        class ZohoCRMFriend(ZohoCRMRecord):
            """Zoho CRM Custom Module "Friends"."""
        
            _module_name = 'Friends'
        ```
        
        Zoho converts the module's field such that:
        * Spaces are replaced with underscores and 
        * The capitalization of each word is preserved
        
        Therefore, you can add a `Friend`  record by doing the following:
        
        ```
        # ZohoCRMFRriend has already been defined
        # a valid oauth token has been retrieved
        
        friend.First_Name = "John"
        friend.Last_Name = "Doe"
        friend.Email = "email@example.com"
        friend.Favorite_Color = "blue"
        
        print(friend.Favorite_Color)
        ```
