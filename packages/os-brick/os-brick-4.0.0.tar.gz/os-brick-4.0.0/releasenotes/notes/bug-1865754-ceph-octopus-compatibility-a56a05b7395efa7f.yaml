    `Bug #1865754 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1865754>`_:
    Fix to the rbd connector to work with Ceph Octopus (Version 15.2.0 and
    later). Octopus has slightly changed its requirements such that it now
    needs a ``[global]`` heading at the beginning of the ``ini`` config file
    that is generated within the ``RBDConnector`` class.  This release
    detects the Ceph version and supplies the appropriate config file.
