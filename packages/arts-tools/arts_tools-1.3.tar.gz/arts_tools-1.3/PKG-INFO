        Processing scripts for Apertif Radio Transient System data
        
        ## Requirements
        * python >= 3.6
        * numpy >= 1.17
        * astropy
        * psrqpy
        
        ## Installation
        `pip install arts_tools`
        
        ## Finding known pulsars in the Apertif field-of-view
        To find which pulsars are within the field of a given pointing, run 
        `arts_find_pulsars_in_field --ra hh:mm:ss.s --dec dd:mm:ss.s`. This tool also prints in which 
        compound beam the pulsars should be, so you only need to download those CBs from the archive instead of the
        entire observation. \
        To convert the tied-array beam data, which have frequency-and time-dependent pointing,
        to a beam tracking a single point on the sky, use [arts_tracking_beams](https://github.com/loostrum/arts_tracking_beams). 
        
        ## Fixing archival FITS files
        FITS files retrieved from the Apertif Long-Term Archive (ALTA) from before 2020/04/08 can be made readable with 
        `arts_fix_fits_from_before_20200408 file.fits`. These fixes are applied:
        1. The NAXIS2 value in the header is changed from zero to the correct value
        2. The data size is expressed in bytes instead of bits
        3. The frequency and time axes of the data are swapped
        4. The frequency order of the data and weights, scales, offsets, and frequencies columns is flipped
        
        By default, the script appends `_fixed` to the filename. Run `arts_fix_fits_from_before_20200408 -h` for more options.
        
        #### Note for Science Verification Campaign data
        Data from the SVC has a correct NAXIS2 value in some cases. However, the other fixes do need to be applied. 
        This can be forced by running `arts_fix_fits_from_before_20200408 --force file.fits`.
        
        ## Reading parametersets
        The FITS headers contain an encoded observation parameterset. To print the parameterset, use 
        `arts_read_parameterset file.fits`. It can also be loaded in python as a dictionary with:
        ```python
        from arts_tools import read_parameterset
        parset = read_parameterset('/path/to/file.fits')
        ```
        Note that all values are read as strings.
