# Read about how you can define batches of runs here:
#   https://samsung.github.io/qaboard/docs/batches-running-on-multiple-inputs/
# It can be as simple as
my-batch:
  inputs:
    - A.jpg
    - B.jpg


# There is a lot of flexibility to specify different choices of databases, configurations,
# create "test matrices", or use standard YAML features to avoid repetition
