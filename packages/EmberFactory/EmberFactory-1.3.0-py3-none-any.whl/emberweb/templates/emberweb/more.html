<p> This application is written in Python,
    with the help of the <a href="https://www.reportlab.com">ReportLab</a> library
    (the web part is powered by the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">flask</a> framework).
    The code is open-source
    and is available here: <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory">framagit.org</a>.
    The ability of this application to reproduce several figures (independently) published by the IPCC was
    carefully tested. However, this is not a product of the IPCC (which is
    not responsible for projects or researches).
<p>
<h1>Versions</h1>
<p>
    Although the web application and layout details were improved over time, there is no change affecting the translation
    of the risk levels provided as input to colours in the burning embers. The changes are recorded on
    <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory">framagit.org</a>. A short summary is provided below.
</p>
<h2>2020/08: Median value in the transitions and better handling of input file issues</h2>
An optinal median, or 'midpoint' between the start and end of each transition, is added in the 'Basic format'.
This results in the 'standard template' provided in <a href="{{ url_for('.examples')}}">Examples and documentation</a>.
Input files containing missing data, errors, or other unexpected characteristics are better handled, through workarounds
and/or improved feedback messages to users.

<h1>Development history</h1>
<p>
This software was created by philippe.marbaix -at- uclouvain.be at the end of 2019.
The first objective was to produce a figure for a paper that is now accepted for publication (08/2020).
Help is welcome to further improve the application. All contributions will be recognised :-).
