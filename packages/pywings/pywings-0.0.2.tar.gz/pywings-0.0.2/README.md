## Welcome!

PyWings extends support for Data Structures and Algorithms to Python environment. It is designed to provide simple, reliable and modular abstractions to accelerate efficient and scaalable software development. PyWings is also designed to be simple to understand, easy to write and use advanced data structures and algorithms. 

Unlike some other libraries PyWings is flexible and extends scope for further development. Modules are designed with time and space complexity in mind for production ready behaviour. Multiple base modules are provided to build custom data structres and algorithms to accelerate prototyping and research.


## Getting Started

For a more in-depth tutorial, you can check out:

Look more [examples](https://github.com/nityansuman/pywings/tree/master/examples/) for more.


### Install

If you want to use the PyWings API in your code, install is as simple as:
```
$ pip install pywings
```

### Uninstall

If you want to uninstall PyWings:
```
$ pip uninstall -y pywings
```
