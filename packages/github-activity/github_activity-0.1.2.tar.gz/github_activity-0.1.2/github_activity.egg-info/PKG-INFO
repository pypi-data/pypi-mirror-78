Description: # github-activity
        
        Generate simple markdown changelogs for GitHub repositories written in Python.
        
        This package does two things:
        
        1. Given a GitHub org, repository, an initial git reference or date, use the
           [GitHub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) to return a DataFrame
           of all issue and PR activity for this time period.
        2. A CLI to render this activity as markdown, suitable for generating changelogs or
           community updates.
        
        *Note: This is a really young tool so it might change a bit over time.*
        
        ## Installation
        
        The easiest way to install this package is to do so directly from GitHub with `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/choldgraf/github-activity
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The easiest way to use `github-activity` to generate activity markdown is to use
        the command-line interface. It takes the following form:
        
        ```
        github-activity <org>/<repo> --since <date or ref> --until <date or ref>
        ```
        
        See [the github-activity documentation](https://github-activity.readthedocs.io)
        for more information.
