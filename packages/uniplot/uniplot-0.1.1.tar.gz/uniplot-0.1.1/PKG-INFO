Description: Simple plotting tool.
        
        When working with production data science code it can be handy to have simple plotting
        tool that does not rely on graphics dependencies or works only in a Jupyter notebook.
        
        I use this all the time when transforming exploratory code to production Python code.
        
        A common use case is having plots as part of your CI pipeline - that way whenever
        something goes wrong, you get not only the error and backtrace but also plots that show
        what the problem was.
