Description: # PFPy - PowerFactory with Python
        
        [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pfpy/badge/?version=latest)](https://pfpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        PFPy provides a wrapper around PowerFactory's Python API with additional features in  `pfpy.pf`. 
        Furthermore,  `pfpy.models` provides a high-level access to PowerFactory models, e.g. via:
        - `model.simulate()`
        - `model.linearize()`
        - `model.set_params()`
        
        It has been developed at the Division of Electric Power and Energy Systems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
        
        The code has been tested with PowerFactory 2019 and PowerFactory 2020. Note that $PYTHONPATH needs to point to the PowerFactory Python API.
        
        ## Examples
        The PowerFactory model used in all of the examples is located in [./examples/data/models/PFPY_DEMO.pfd](https://github.com/tinrabuzin/PFPy/blob/master/examples/data/models/PFPY_DEMO.pfd)
        
        ### Simulation Example
        
        The simulation of the aforementioned model is demonstrated in the [simulation example](https://github.com/tinrabuzin/PFPy/blob/master/examples/simulation_with_inputs.py).
        The model contains a controllable voltage source at the PCC. CSV files are generated that are replayed at the PCC, simulation is executed and the results are plotted.
        
        ### Linearization Examples
        
        The same model is linearized as seen from the PCC in the following [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tinrabuzin/PFPy/blob/master/examples/linearization.ipynb).
        When compared to the linearization in PowerFacory, this code, in addition to the A matrix, provides also B,C, and D matrices.
