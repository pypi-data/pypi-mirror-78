#QULOD_PIDFILE="/tmp/qulod.pid" # WRONG!!!

#  As the openrc documentation [1] seems to imply, the PIDFILEs should be handled
# in a different way.
#
#  * if the programs need to run as non-priviledged user (for testing or whatever)
#    then set a non-default value in command line (lmaster -p ...).
#  * if the program is launched by a priviledged user, there is no need to set
#    a non-standard pidfile
