            **This is work in progress!**
        
            Some features marked with **Warning: TBD!** are not yet developed.
        
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        **FrUCToSA** stands for **Fr**\ ankfurt **U**\ niversity **C**\ luster **T**\ ool **o**\ f
        **S**\ oftware **A**\ nalysis.
        
        It is a simple tool to
        
        1. collect, and
        2. analyze
        
        data from software running on a cluster (like Goethe-HLR_) ---and from the cluster itself---
        and to analyze that data with performance "in mind".
        
        
        **FrUCToSA** is made of two elements:
        
        * **LiMon**: a **Li**\ ght **Mon**\ itor that collects data.
        * **PerA**: a **Per**\ formance **A**\ nalyzer that analyzes the data and
          classifies it.  **Warning: TBD!**
        
        The package provides several programs:
        
        * ``fructosad``: main program. It works in the background (as a service/daemon) orchestrating
          all the system. **Warning: TBD!**
        * ``lagent``: ``LiMon`` agent. Customizable service/daemon that collects performance data
          from the a node on the cluster. It runs locally and collects data from sensors that can be
          activated and configured via a configuration file.
        * ``lmaster``: ``LiMon`` master. Another service/daemon that controls the agents and collects
          data from them. It runs in a master node of the cluster; it is controled via a configuration
          file.
        * ``perad``: another service/daemon that analyzes the data and classifies it according to
          the performance  **Warning: TBD!**
        * ``make-fructosa-dashboard``: to generate Grafana dashboards.
        
        **FrUCToSA** is developed in Python at the CSC_ (Goethe Universitaet Frankfurt) under the
        GPL3 license.

        Installation
        ============
           
        Just install the FrUCToSA package from PyPI: ::
        
          $ pip install FrUCToSA
        
        
          
        Usage
        =====
        
        1. Configure ``lmaster`` and ``lagent``
        2. [optional] Start Graphite (the data will be sent to it)
        3. [optional] Start Grafana and connect it to Graphite: this is an easy way to have
           nice plots and dashboards.
        4. Start ``lmaster`` (see the output of ``lmaster -h``, to learn about some parameters
           to control ``lmaster``)::
        
              # lmaster start
        
           A configuration file is needed. By default the configuration file is
           ``/etc/fructosa/lmaster.conf`` but that can be changed from the command line.
        
           A typical configuration might be::
        
              [lmaster]
              host = localhost
              incoming data port = 7888
              
              [logging]
              filename = /tmp/limon.log
              maxBytes = 1073741824
              backupCount = 10
              level = DEBUG
        
           No option is mandatory. In the file ``fructosa/constants.py`` the defaults are defined.
           
        5. Start ``lagent`` on one or several computers (again, see the output of ``lagent -h``,
           for more details)::
        
              # lagent start
        
           A configuration file is needed. By default the configuration file is
           ``/etc/fructosa/lagent.conf``, but can be changed from the command line.
           In this configuration file is where the needed *sensor*\ s are activated.
           A typical configuration with the master and the agent running locally
           looks like this::
              
              [lmaster]
              host = localhost
              incoming data port = 7888
        
              [Graphite]
              host = localhost
              carbon receiver pickle port = 2004
              
              [logging]
              filename = /tmp/limon.log
              maxBytes = 1073741824
              backupCount = 10
              level = DEBUG
        
              [sensor:CPUPercent]
              time_interval = 10
              
              [sensor:VirtualMemory]
              time_interval = 30
              
              [sensor:CPUTimes]
              time_interval = 30
              
              [sensor:CPUTimesPercent]
              time_interval = 10
              
              [sensor:CPUCount]
              time_interval = 300
              
              [sensor:CPUStats]
              time_interval = 30
              
              [sensor:CPUFreq]
              time_interval = 300
              
              [sensor:SwapMemory]
              time_interval = 60
              
              [sensor:DiskPartitions]
              time_interval = 60
              
              [sensor:DiskUsage]
              time_interval = 30
              #path = /
              
              [sensor:DiskIOCounters]
              time_interval = 20
              
              [sensor:NetIOCounters]
              time_interval = 10
              
              [sensor:NetConnections]
              time_interval = 20
              
              [sensor:NetIFAddrs]
              time_interval = 30
              
              [sensor:NetIFStats]
              time_interval = 30
              
              [sensor:SensorsTemperatures]
              time_interval = 30
              
              [sensor:SensorsFans]
              time_interval = 30
              
              [sensor:SensorsBattery]
              time_interval = 30
              
              [sensor:BootTime]
              time_interval = 300
              
              [sensor:Users]
              time_interval = 10
        
           This is just an example with many sensors active. No option is mandatory. But if ``lagent``
           must measure anything, some sensor must be explicitly given. In the file
           ``fructosa/constants.py`` the defaults are defined.
           The *time* given in the ``time_interval`` option is understood to be in *seconds*.
           If the agent runs on a different computer as the master, the ``host`` entry in the
           ``lmaster`` section must be adjusted accordingly.
        
        
        Security
        ========
        
        All the communications between ``lmaster`` and ``lagent`` are *bona fide*. There are
        no authentication or encryption mechanisms for now.
           
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * Change ``constants.py``: ``lagent``, ``lmaster`` -> ``limon``
        * ``lagent`` should have an option to display the available sensors and some help for each sensor.
        * Sensors should accept options: the mechanism is almost there, but need to be completed.
        * Add sensors to read data from GPUs.
        * Connect to Slurm.  
        * Add configuration options to manage ``Graphite``:
        
          * send data to it or not? (yes by default)
        
        * openrc scripts to manage the whole system:
        
          * *start* 
        
            1. start graphite
            2. start grafana (?)
            3. start lmaster
            4. start lagents where needed
        
          * *stop*
        
            1. stop lagents
            2. stop lmaster
            3. stop grafana (?)
            4. stop graphite
        
          * *restart*
          * ``/etc/conf.d/fructosa`` with info about *what* to do.
          * ``/etc/fructosa/fructosa.conf`` with info about *how* to do.
        
        * Grafana node dashboard:
        
          * why data from some nodes does not arrive?
          * set different default times (length and refres)
          * active job number
          * table of processes with highest load
            
        * LAgent should be able to change frequency of measurements depending on the situation
          of the node
