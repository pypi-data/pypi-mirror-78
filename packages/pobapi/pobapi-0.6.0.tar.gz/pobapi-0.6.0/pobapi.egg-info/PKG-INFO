        Introduction
        ------------
        
        | Path Of Building API provides a comprehensive toolbox for processing
            `Path of Building <https://github.com/Openarl/PathOfBuilding>`_ pastebins.
        | It is aimed at community developers:
        
        * looking to add Path of Building functionality to their apps.
        * upgrading from existing solutions.
        
        Benefits from using this library:
        
        * Focus on your app's core competences
        * Spend your free time on unique features
        * Backwards-compatibility as PoB's export format changes
        * Tested and secure codebase
        
        Features

            * Skills, skill groups and links
            * Gear and item sets
            * Path of Building configuration settings
            * Build author's notes
        * Exposes all of Path of Building's relevant stats and attributes in a simple and pythonic way.
        * Automatically calculates mod values on theorycrafted items.
        * Low memory footprint through slots and dynamically generated attributes.
