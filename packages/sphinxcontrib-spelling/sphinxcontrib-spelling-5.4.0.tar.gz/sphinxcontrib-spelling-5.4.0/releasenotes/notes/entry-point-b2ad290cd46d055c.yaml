    The builder is now registered using an entry point, so that if the
    ``spelling`` directive is not used in a project
    ``sphinxcontrib.spelling`` does not need to be included explicitly
    in the ``extensions`` list in ``conf.py`` in order to use it with
    the project on the command line.
