   Add a configuration option ``spelling_exclude_patterns`` to manage
   skipping spell checking for some input files. The option uses a
   list of glob-style patterns that are matched against the source
   file names relative to the source directory. See :doc:`/customize`
   for more details. Contributed by sdelliot.
