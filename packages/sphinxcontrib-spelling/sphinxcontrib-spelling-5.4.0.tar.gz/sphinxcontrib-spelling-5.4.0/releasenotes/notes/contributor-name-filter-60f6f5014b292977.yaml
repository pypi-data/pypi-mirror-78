    Added a new filter
    (``sphinxcontrib.spelling.filters.ContributorFilter``) that treats
    contributor names extracted from the git history as spelled
    correctly, making it easier to refer to the names in
    acknowledgments . Includes a new configuration option,
    ``spelling_ignore_contributor_names`` to enable it.
