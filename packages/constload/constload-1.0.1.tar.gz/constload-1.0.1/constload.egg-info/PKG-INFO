        constload is a package designed to simplify the process of loading settings into Python applications by providing
        certain functionality that is frequently reimplemented from project to project. This includes the ability to set
        defaults and set certain parameters as required.
        
        ### Usage examples
        
        When loading settings, you have a couple of options. You can provide pre-parsed data in a dictionary, or you have have
        data parsed for you from a filepath or from a string.
        
        ```python
        from constload import ConstantLoader
        
        # Loading JSON from file
        c = ConstantLoader("/path/to/settings/file.json")
        
        # Loading JSON from string
        c = ConstantLoader("{'hello': 'world'}")
        
        # Using preloaded dict
        c = ConstantLoader(your_dict)
        ```
        
        It's also trivial to write your own loaders.
        
        ```python
        def my_loader(data):
            # Basic CSV loader
            my_dict = {}
            lines = data.split("\n")
            for line in lines:
                vals = line.split(",")
                my_dict[vals[0]] = vals[1:]
            return my_dict
        
        c = ConstantLoader("/path/to/file.csv", loader=my_loader)
        
        ```
        
        When you've got your data loaded, you can begin to extract values.
        
        This is done by using tuples that contain paths to your values.
        
        ```python
        # ("user", "name") is equivalent to ["user"]["name"]
        USER_NAME = c.required(("user", "name"))
        USER_PETS = c.default(("user", "pets"), [])
        ```
        
        Any changes made by `c.default` are automatically mirrored to the dictionary as they're being made. This means you can
        work directly with the dictionary, if you so choose.
        
        ```python
        c.default(("user", "pets"), [])
        c.data["user", "name"]  # -> []
        ```
