Description: ![albus][albus-header]
        
        This Python data mapper library was created thinking on simplicity learning
        and using it. As opposed to other ORM options, this one will not be as powerful
        and flexible in terms of queries. That is the trade-off to make it simpler to
        learn and use.
        
        # Usage
        
        Defining models is done using property descriptors as you would for SQLAlchemy
        and Django. Querying them is completely different in regards to how we avoid
        overriding Python operators or using dynamic keyword arguments.
        
        ```python
        from albus.model import Model
        from albus import field
        
        
        class Book(Model):
        
            author = field.StringField()
            title = field.StringField()
            year = field.IntegerField()
        
        
        query = Book.new_query()
        query.filter_equals('author', 'John Doe')
        query.filter_greater('year', 2000)
        
        results = query.select()
        for current in results:
            print('Found:', current.title)
        ```
