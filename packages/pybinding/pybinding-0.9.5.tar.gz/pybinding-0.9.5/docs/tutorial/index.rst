Tutorial
========

This section will present the essential features of pybinding with example code to get you started
quickly. The tutorial assumes that you already have a basic understanding of tight-binding theory,
the `Python 3 programming language <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_ and at least part of
the `scientific Python stack (SciPy) <http://www.scipy.org/docs.html>`_. But don't worry: while
this tutorial will not specifically explain basic language and scientific Python concepts, they
are presented in a straightforward way and will be easy to pick up on the fly.

    Note that most of the tutorial pages are also available for download as
    `Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`_. If you don't use Jupyter,
    you can safely ignore the notebooks: they contain the same text as the
    tutorial, just with interactive code cells.
