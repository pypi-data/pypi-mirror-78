   :description: Crystal lattice definition in pybinding

A :class:`.Lattice` object describes the unit cell of a crystal lattice. This includes the
primitive vectors, positions of sublattice sites and hopping parameters which connect those sites.
All of this structural information is used to build up a larger system by translation.

Square lattice
--------------

Starting from the basics, we'll create a simple square lattice.

.. plot::
    :context: reset
    :nofigs:

    import pybinding as pb

    d = 0.2  # [nm] unit cell length
    t = 1    # [eV] hopping energy

    # create a simple 2D lattice with vectors a1 and a2
    lattice = pb.Lattice(a1=[d, 0], a2=[0, d])
    lattice.add_sublattices(
        ('A', [0, 0])  # add an atom called 'A' at position [0, 0]
    )
    lattice.add_hoppings(
        # (relative_index, from_sublattice, to_sublattice, energy)
        ([0, 1], 'A', 'A', t),
        ([1, 0], 'A', 'A', t)
    )


It may not be immediately obvious what this code does. Fortunately, :class:`.Lattice` objects
have a convenient :meth:`.Lattice.plot()` method to easily visualize the constructed lattice.

.. plot::
    :context:
    :alt: Unit cell of a simple square crystal lattice

    lattice.plot()  # plot the lattice that was just constructed
    plt.show()      # standard matplotlib show() function

In the figure we see lattice vectors :math:`a_1` and :math:`a_2` which were used to initialize
:class:`.Lattice`. These vectors describe a Bravais lattice with an infinite set of positions,

.. math::
    \vec{R} = n_1 \vec{a}_1 + n_2 \vec{a}_2,

where :math:`n_1` and :math:`n_2` are integers. The blue circle labeled A represents the atom
which was created with the :meth:`.Lattice.add_sublattices()` method. The slightly faded out
circles represent translations of the lattice in the primitive vector directions, i.e. using
the integer index :math:`[n_1, n_2]`.

The hoppings are specified using the :meth:`.Lattice.add_hoppings()` method and each one consists
of `(relative_index, from_sublattice, to_sublattice, energy)`:

* The main cell always has the index :math:`[n_1, n_2]` = [0, 0]. The `relative_index` represents
  the number of integer steps needed to reach another cell starting from the main one. Each cell
  is labeled with its `relative_index`, as seen in the figure.

* A hopping is created between the main cell and a neighboring cell specified by `relative_index`.
  Two hoppings are added in the definition: [0, 1] and [1, 0]. The opposite hoppings [0, -1] and
  [-1, 0] are added automatically to maintain hermiticity.

* This lattice consists of only one sublattice so the `from` and `to` sublattice fields
  are trivial. Generally, `from_sublattice` indicates the sublattice in the [0, 0] cell
  and `to_sublattice` in the neighboring cell. This will be explained further in the next example.

* The last parameter is simply the value of the hopping energy.

It's good practice to build the lattice inside a function to make it easily reusable.
Here we define the same lattice as before, but note that the unit cell length and hopping energy
are function arguments, which makes the lattice easily configurable.

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs
    :alt: Unit cell of a simple square crystal lattice

    def square_lattice(d, t):
        lat = pb.Lattice(a1=[d, 0], a2=[0, d])
        lat.add_sublattices(('A', [0, 0]))
        lat.add_hoppings(([0, 1], 'A', 'A', t),
                         ([1, 0], 'A', 'A', t))
        return lat

    # we can quickly set a shorter unit length `d`
    lattice = square_lattice(d=0.1, t=1)
    lattice.plot()
    plt.show()


Graphene
--------

The next example shows a slightly more complicated two-atom lattice of graphene.

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs
    :alt: Unit cell of graphene's crystal lattice

    from math import sqrt

    def monolayer_graphene():
        a = 0.24595   # [nm] unit cell length
        a_cc = 0.142  # [nm] carbon-carbon distance
        t = -2.8      # [eV] nearest neighbour hopping

        lat = pb.Lattice(a1=[a, 0],
                         a2=[a/2, a/2 * sqrt(3)])
        lat.add_sublattices(('A', [0, -a_cc/2]),
                            ('B', [0,  a_cc/2]))
        lat.add_hoppings(
            # inside the main cell
            ([0,  0], 'A', 'B', t),
            # between neighboring cells
            ([1, -1], 'A', 'B', t),
            ([0, -1], 'A', 'B', t)
        )
        return lat

    lattice = monolayer_graphene()
    lattice.plot()
    plt.show()

The :meth:`.Lattice.add_sublattices()` method creates atoms A and B (blue and orange) at different
offsets: :math:`[0, -a_{cc}/2]` and :math:`[0, a_{cc}/2]`. Once again, the translated cells are
given at positions :math:`\vec{R} = n_1 \vec{a}_1 + n_2 \vec{a}_2`, however, this time the lattice
vectors are not perpendicular which makes the integer indices :math:`[n_1, n_2]` slightly more
complicate (see the labels in the figure).

The hoppings are defined as follows:

* `([0,  0], 'A', 'B', t)` specifies the hopping inside the main cell, from atom A to B. The main
  [0,0] cell is never labeled in the figure, but it is always the central cell where the lattice
  vectors originate.
* `([1, -1], 'A', 'B', t)` specifies the hopping between [0, 0] and [1, -1], from A to B. The
  opposite hopping is added automatically: [-1, 1], from B to A. In the tight-binding matrix
  representation, the opposite hopping is the Hermitian conjugate of the first one. The lattice
  specification always requires explicitly mentioning only one half of the hoppings while the
  other half is automatically added to guarantee hermiticity.
* `([0, -1], 'A', 'B', t)` is handled in the very same way.

The :meth:`.Lattice.plot()` method will always faithfully draw any lattice that has been specified.
It serves as a handy visual inspection tool.


Brillouin zone
--------------

The method :meth:`.Lattice.plot_brillouin_zone()` is another handy tool that does just as its
name implies.

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs
    :alt: Brillouin zone of graphene

    lattice = monolayer_graphene()
    lattice.plot_brillouin_zone()

The reciprocal lattice vectors :math:`b_1` and :math:`b_2` are calculated automatically based
on the real space vectors. There is no need to specify them manually. The first Brillouin zone
is determined as the Wignerâ€“Seitz cell in reciprocal space. By default, the plot method labels
the vertices of the Brillouin zone.


Material repository
-------------------

A few common lattices are included in pybinding's :doc:`/materials/index`. You can get started
quickly by importing one of them. For example:

.. plot::
    :alt: Unit cell of bilayer graphene

    from pybinding.repository import graphene
    lattice = graphene.bilayer()
    lattice.plot()


Further reading
---------------

Additional features of the :class:`.Lattice` class are explained in the :doc:`Advanced Topics </advanced/lattice>`
section. For more lattice specifications check out the :doc:`examples section </examples/lattice/index>`.
