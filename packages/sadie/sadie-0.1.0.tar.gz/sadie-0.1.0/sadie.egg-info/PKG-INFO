        Sadie is an agent-based modelling environment for stochastic agents in discrete time in Euclidean space. It is intended
        to serve as a simple, convenient replacement for more complex agent-based modelling frameworks such as Repast and Mesa
        where customisation and adaptation to specific use cases is required. In particular, Sadie is designed for simulating
        random walks in various complex interactions, including LÃ©vy walks, avoidant walks, homesick and other stochastic
        mobility models in Euclidean space.
