        ## Overview
        
        Current Version: **0.1.1**
        
        Investors use news articles to gain an idea of market sentiment and hopefully
        be able to predict the direction of markets based on the sentiment of these
        articles and how they are published. The `finnews` library is designed to help
        the collection of news articles related to business topics and market news easy
        and efficient.
        
        ## Setup
        
        To **install** the library, run the following command from the terminal.
        
        ```console
        pip install fin-news
        ```
        
        To **upgrade** the library, run the following command from the terminal.
        
        ```console
        pip install --upgrade fin-news
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here is a simple example of using the `finnews` library to to grab the top stories
        on CNBC.
        
        ```python
        from pprint import pprint
        from finnews.client import News
        
        # Create a new instance of the News Client.
        news_client = News()
        
        # Grab the CNBC News Client.
        cnbc_news_client = news_client.cnbc
        
        # Grab the top news.
        cbnc_top_news = cnbc_news_client.news_feed(topic='top_news')
        
        # Print it.
        pprint(cbnc_top_news)
