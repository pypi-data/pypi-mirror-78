## Overview

Current Version: **0.1.1**

Investors use news articles to gain an idea of market sentiment and hopefully
be able to predict the direction of markets based on the sentiment of these
articles and how they are published. The `finnews` library is designed to help
the collection of news articles related to business topics and market news easy
and efficient.

## Setup

To **install** the library, run the following command from the terminal.

```console
pip install fin-news
```

To **upgrade** the library, run the following command from the terminal.

```console
pip install --upgrade fin-news
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of using the `finnews` library to to grab the top stories
on CNBC.

```python
from pprint import pprint
from finnews.client import News

# Create a new instance of the News Client.
news_client = News()

# Grab the CNBC News Client.
cnbc_news_client = news_client.cnbc

# Grab the top news.
cbnc_top_news = cnbc_news_client.news_feed(topic='top_news')

# Print it.
pprint(cbnc_top_news)
```
