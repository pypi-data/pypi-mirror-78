"""A toolkit for symbolic music generation.

MusPy is an open source Python library for symbolic music generation. It
provides essential tools for developing a music generation system,
including dataset management, data I/O, data preprocessing and model
evaluation.

Features
--------

- Dataset management system for commonly used datasets with interfaces
  to PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Data I/O for common symbolic music formats (e.g., MIDI, MusicXML and
  ABC) and interfaces to other symbolic music libraries (e.g., music21,
  mido, pretty_midi and Pypianoroll).
- Implementations of common music representations for music generation,
  including the pitch-based, the event-based, the piano-roll and the
  note-based representations.
- Model evaluation tools for music generation systems, including audio
  rendering, score and piano-roll visualizations and objective metrics.
