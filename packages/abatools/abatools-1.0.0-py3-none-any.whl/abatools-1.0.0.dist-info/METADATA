# Android Boot Animation Tools

### Simple command line utility for working with Android Boot Animations

This utility is made to simplify the process of creating Android-ready bootanimation.zip files

To install:  

Clone this git repository, and from the top-level directory (where setup.py is):

	pip3 install .

Alternatively, you can get the package from PyPi using:

	pip3 install abatools

Once installed, the abatools utility should be available from the command line.  Example:

	abatools -a bootanimation.zip

Help is available from the command line with the -h or --help option, but basic usage is as follows:  

  -a [filename.zip]     zip all files/folders in current directory totarget [filename.zip]
  -g [[gif file] [filename] [[gif file] [filename] ...]]
                        creates a boot animation from a target .gif and saves it to [filename.zip]
