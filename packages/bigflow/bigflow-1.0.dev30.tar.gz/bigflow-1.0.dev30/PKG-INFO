        ## Installing BigFlow
        
        **Prerequisites**. Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed:
        
        1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7
        2. [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive)
        3. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)  
        
        You can install the `bigflow` package globally but we recommend to 
        install it locally with `venv`, in your project's folder:
        
        ```bash
        python -m venv .bigflow_env
        source .bigflow_env/bin/activate
        ```
        
        Install the `bigflow` PIP package:
        
        ```bash
        pip install bigflow
        ```
        
        Test it:
        
        ```shell
        bigflow -h
        ```
        
        Read more about [BigFlow CLI](docs/cli.md).
