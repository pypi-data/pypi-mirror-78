Description: # Cipher Module
        
        Have you ever wanted to use ciphers in **python**?
        If you have, you know that it's really hard to make functions for your cipher of choice,
        
        **So that's why I made this module!**
        You can use this module to simplify your ciphering process!
        # Ciphers
        
        This module, supports following ciphers (Note: other ciphers will be added to the module):
        - Caeser
        - Atbash
        - Vigenere
        - Base64
        - A1Z26
        
        # How to use
        
        Every cipher, has a ``encode`` and ``decode`` function.
        
        Most of them, take the argument `text` or `code`, but some of them, take more argument, like **Vigenere** which takes a `key` argument
