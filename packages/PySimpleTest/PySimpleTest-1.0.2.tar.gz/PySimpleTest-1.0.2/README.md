# PySimpleTest -- Make test as simple as possible

PySimpleTest is a very simple test framwork. To start using it, try following example:  
Write a file `main.py`:
```
from PySimpleTest import *

a = 2
should_be_equal(a, 2)
should_be_less(a, 1)
```
Then run it. You can get following cmd output:
