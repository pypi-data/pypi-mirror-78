PyProb is a [probabilistic programming](http://probabilistic-programming.org) system for simulators and high-performance computing (HPC), based on [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/). The main focus of PyProb is on coupling existing simulation code bases with probabilistic inference with minimal intervention.

PyProb is currently a research prototype, with more
documentation and examples on the way. Watch this space!

### Support for multiple languages

We support front ends in multiple languages through the
[PPX](https://github.com/pyprob/ppx) interface that allows execution of models
and inference engines in separate programming languages, processes, and machines
connected over a network.

### Inference engines

PyProb currently provides the following inference engines:
* Markov chain Monte Carlo
  * Lightweight Metropolis Hastings (LMH)
  * Random-walk Metropolis Hastings (RMH)
* Importance sampling
  * Regular sequential importance sampling (proposals from prior)
  * Inference compilation

Inference compilation is an amortized inference technique for performing fast
repeated inference using deep neural networks to parameterize proposal
distributions for importance sampling. We are planning to add other inference engines, e.g., variational inference.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:

* Python 3.5 or higher. We recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/).
* PyTorch 1.5.1 or higher, installed by following instructions on the [PyTorch
  web site](http://pytorch.org/).

### Install from source
To use a cutting-edge version, clone this repository and install the PyProb package using:

```
git clone https://github.com/pyprob/pyprob.git
cd pyprob
pip install .
```

### Install the latest package
To use the latest version available in [Python Package
Index](https://pypi.org/project/pyprob/), run:

```
