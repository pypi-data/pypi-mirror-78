        An improved ls for xonsh, inspired by lsd

        The asciinema demo isn't great as it doesn't seem to account for the emoji's cell width.
        
        # Features
        
        - Emojis
        - Colors
        - A `tree`-like display when called recursively
        - Customizable
        - Written in python so it doesn't need to run a separate binary
        
        # Installation
        
        Install the `xontrib-xlsd` package
        ```bash
        pip install --user xontrib-xlsd
        ```
        
        And load it from your `.xonshrc`
        ```bash
        xontrib load xlsd
        ```
        
        # Customizing
        
        ## `-l` mode columns
        
        ### Changing the columns/the order
        
        In your `.xonshrc`, define a `$XLSD_LIST_COLUMNS` environment variable and set it's value to your desires.
        
        The default value (similar to coreutil's `ls`) is the following:
        ```bash
        $XLSD_LIST_COLUMNS = ['mode', 'hardlinks', 'uid', 'gid', 'size', 'mtime', 'name']
        ```
        
        All the built-in columns are used in this config.
        
        ### Writing your own column
        
        A column is a function taking for only argument an `os.DirEntry` and that outputs a string.
        
        A simple filename column could be registered like this:
        ```python
        @xlsd_register_column('filename', ColumnAlignment.LEFT)
        def _xlsd_column_filename(direntry):
            return direntry.name
        ```
