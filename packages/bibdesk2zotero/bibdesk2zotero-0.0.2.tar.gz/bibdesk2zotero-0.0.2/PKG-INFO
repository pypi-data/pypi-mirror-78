Description: # bibdesk2zotero
        
        This is a little utility for rewriting a BibDesk BibTeX file so that it can be
        read by Zotero with the file references intact. BibDesk and Zotero mostly get
        along except for the way BibFile stores links to documents like PDFs. This
        utility Base64 decodes all Bdesk-File paths, parses the serialized [plist],
        extracts the relative path to the file and adds it back to the bibliographic
        entry as an absolute path.
