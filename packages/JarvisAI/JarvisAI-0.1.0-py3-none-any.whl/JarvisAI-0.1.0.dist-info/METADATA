 5. Future?

## 1. What is Jarvis AI-
Jarvis AI is a Python Module which is able to perform task like Chatbot, Assistant etc. Currently it is in development stage. Currently only support CLI method, no UI yet. Well, you can contribute on this project to make it more powerful.

Check more details here- https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI

## 2. Prerequisite-

* To use it only Python (> 3.6) is required.
* To contribute in project: Python is the only prerequisite for basic scripting, Machine Learning and Deep Learning knowledge will help this model to do task like AI-ML. Read How to contribute section of this page.

## 3. Getting Started (How to use it)-

 ### Install the latest version-
 `pip install JarvisAI`

 It will install all the required package automatically, the spacy language model will download automatically.

 *If anything not install then you can install requirements manually.* 
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 The [requirementx.txt](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/blob/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/requirements.txt) can be found [here](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/blob/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/requirements.txt).

 https://pypi.org/project/JarvisAI/


### Usage and Features-

After installing the library you can import the module-
`import JarvisAI`
It will start automatically, you will asked to enter text (input).

#### Commands and features-

1. **Setup Jarvis Ai-**
	Setup basic details about user which [Jarvis](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI) will use to provide results to user.
	- *Example:* Setup / Set up / Let's Setup etc.

2. **Ask weather-**
		Weather forecasting accroding to input, if no city found in input then it will fetch city from the setup configuration. The default city is Pune, India.
	 - *Example:* What is the weather? / What is temerature?  / What is temperature in `your city`? / Weather etc.

3. **Ask time and date-**
	- *Example:* tell me time, tell me date/

4. **About me-**
	 Basic details about the user. The details according to setup configuration.
	 - **Example:** about me / about / what do you know about me.

5. **Send Mail-**
	Send Email to other. Only Gmail support for now.
	- **Example:** send mail / mail / email / send email.

6. **Open any website-**
	- **Example:** open facebook.com / open amazon.in	

7. **Input from Voice-** No command needed, with latest version `0.1.0` we have added voice input. May not work on Linux or Mac, they can use version `0.0.7` but this version doesn't have much features.

	**Working on new features like chatbot, notes, reminder, perform task, show photos from PC etc**


## 4. How to contribute?

 1. Clone this [reop](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI)
 2. Create virtual environment in python.
 3. Install requirements from [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/blob/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/requirements.txt).
	 `pip install requirements.txt`
4. Now run, [__ init__.py](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/blob/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/__init__.py)
	`python __init__.py`
	(Currently only support input as text, working on input from mic. Mic is in beta stage, sometimes not works)
-  So, once you run the [_ _init__.py](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/blob/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/__init__.py) it will ask you to enter text.  
- It will produce output as text and audio accordingly.
- You no need to run script again and again, it will keep asking you to enter next queries. If you want to stop, just close the script.


 - You can clone the repo and understand how this works.
 - You can add your own features / scripts. Follow this guideline while writing scripts-

	***Guidelines to add your own scripts / modules-***
	Lets understand the projects structure first-

	```
	JarvisAI:.
	â”œâ”€â”€â”€configs
	â”œâ”€â”€â”€features
	â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€setup
	â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€...
	â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€weather
	â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€...
	â””â”€â”€â”€...
	```
	4.1. **All these above things are folders. Lets understand-**


	 - **JarvisAI:** 	Root folder containing all the files
	 - **configs:** It contain the `jarvis_features_config.py` file, it is just a configuration files. Which may need by any script. We will talk about it later.

		```    
		jarvis_features_config = [
		  {
		    "regex": "weather|temperature|wind|clouds|rainy",
		    "import": "features.weather.weather",
		    "function_name": "weather_app"
		  },
		  {
		    "regex": "setup|set up",
		    "import": "features.setup.user_setup",
		    "function_name": "setup_mode"
		  },
		  {
		    "regex": "tell me date|date|today is what day",
		    "import": "features.date_time.jarvis_date_time",
		    "function_name": "tell_me_date"
		  },
		  {
		    "regex": "time",
		    "import": "features.date_time.jarvis_date_time",
		    "function_name": "tell_me_time"
		  },
		  {
		    "regex": "about|about me",
		    "import": "features.about_me.about_me",
		    "function_name": "about_me"
		  }
		]

	 - **features:** All the features supported by JarvisAI. This 'features' folder contains the different modules, you can create your own modules. Example of modules- "[weather](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/tree/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/features/weather)", "[setup](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/tree/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/features/setup)". These are the two folders inside '[features](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/tree/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/features)' directory.
	 - **action.py:** Perform action according to input. It call exact module / function according to user input. If user input matches regex in `jarvis_features_config.py` file then it will call respected function.
	 - **jarvis.py:** Main file to get input from user, call action file and perform action accordingly then show output to user.
	 - **[__ init__.py](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/blob/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/__init__.py):** You need to run this file to test it during the production.

	4.2. **You can create your own modules in this 'features' directory.**

	4.3. **Let's create a module and you can learn by example-**

	- **4.3.1. We will create a module which will tell us a date and time.**

	- **4.3.2. Create a folder (module) name- 'date_time' in features directory.**

	- **4.3.3. Create a python script name- 'jarvis_date_time.py' in 'date_time' folder.**

	- **4.3.4. Write this kind of script (you can modify according to your own script).**  ***Read comments in script below to understand format***- 

		`'features/date_time/jarvis_date_time.py' file-`

		```
		# import statements
		import datetime


		# do not remove data=None, model=None the function format should be same, name can be change
		# inp is the input from the user (query ask by user)
		# you can use this inp inside the function. LOL, because you may need user input
		# Function should return something because this is the output we want to show user
		def tell_me_date(data=None, model=None):
		    """
		    Do not remove data=None, model=None
		    data is:
		    data = {
		            'user_input': inp, # input from user
		            'features_config': jarvis_obj.features_config, # this will use to find the correct funtion which needs to be call
		            'user_config': jarvis_obj.user_config, # user releated configurations. Just print it for more details.
		            'DEV_MODE': DEV_MODE, # True / False is only possible values
		            'jarvis_obj': jarvis_obj # jarvis_obj is object of Jarvis class. Read the jarvis.py for more details.
		        }
		    """
		    date = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%b %d %Y")
		    # the return format should be string or integer only. The only one return should be here.
		    return date


		def tell_me_time(data=None, model=None):
		    time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M")
		    # the return format should be string or integer only
		    return time


		# you can run and test your script by calling from main
		if __name__ == '__main__':
		    response = tell_me_date()
		    print(response)
		    response = tell_me_time()
		    print(response)


	- **4.3.4. Integrate your module to Jarvis AI-**
		- Remember? We have configs folder.
		   We have 'JarvisAI/configs/jarvis_features_config.py' this python file. It contains data releated to run modules.
		 - Format of this py file-
			```
			jarvis_features_config = [
			  {
			    "regex": "weather|temperature|wind|clouds|rainy",
			    "import": "features.weather.weather",
			    "function_name": "weather_app"
			  },
			  {
			    "regex": "setup|set up",
			    "import": "features.setup.user_setup",
			    "function_name": "setup_mode"
			  },
			  {
			    "regex": "about|about me",
			    "import": "features.about_me.about_me",
			    "function_name": "about_me"
			  }

			]


		- At the end of this file add your own dictionary (modules data)-
			```
			jarvis_features_config = [
				{...
				},
				{
				    "regex": "tell me date|date|today is what day",
				    "import": "features.date_time.jarvis_date_time",
				    "function_name": "tell_me_date"
				},
			    {
				    "regex": "time",
				    "import": "features.date_time.jarvis_date_time",
				    "function_name": "tell_me_time"
				},
			]	

		- **regex:** you can put all the possible match pattern which user can aks. Multilple patterns can be seperated by `|` operator. Check existing regex pattern in dictionary before adding your regex. In this case `tell me date|date|today is what day`
		- **import:** you need to put your module's path. In this case- `features.date_time.jarvis_date_time`
		- **function_name:** your function name according to your script file. In this case `tell_me_date` and `tell_me_time`
		- Now, if you added any library in the project (Example- Pandas) then make sure to add it in `requirements.txt`. And also add to `setup.py`  `install_requires=['pandas']`. Make sure your library is not already exist on these two files.
		- Now one last thing, change `DEV_MODE = True` to `DEV_MODE = False` in [_ _init__.py](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Jarvis_AI/blob/master/JarvisAI/JarvisAI/__init__.py).
		*True means you are in development mode. Before pushing it to repo make sure to set it False.*

4.4. **That's it, if you applied all the things as per as guidelines then now just run jarvis.py it should works fine.**

4.5. **Push the repo, we will test it. If found working and good then it will be added to next PyPi version.**

## 5. Future?

Lots of possibilities, GUI, Integrate with GPT-3, support for android, IOT, Home Automation, APIs, as pip package etc.
