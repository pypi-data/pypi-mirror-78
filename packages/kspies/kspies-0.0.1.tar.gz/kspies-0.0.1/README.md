This package simplifies evaluating Kohn-Sham inversion potentials and densities for use in the quantum chemical technique Density Corrected Density Functional Theory (DC-DFT). In addition to documentation of the scientific code, this site includes information on installation, setup, use, and examples of use to equip quantum chemists and physicists with this useful toolkit. Please let us know if you have further questions, suggestions, or ideas.
