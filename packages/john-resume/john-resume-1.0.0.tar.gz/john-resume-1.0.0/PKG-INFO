Description: # John's resume!
        
        I am currently making the most programmer'y resume that I can think of. That means I have to do stupid stuff like adding it to pip. Because why not? Wouldn't be much of a developer resume if it doesn't have:
         * Version control
         * Automated tests
         * Full CI/CD pipeline
         * Automatic deployment
         * Legacy support
        
        And more!
        
        This is totally dumb, but if you're interested [head over to my website](https://www.jmgundersen.net/) and let's be dumb together.
        
        Parameters to use this dumb script:
        ```
         -f : For fast printout
         --json : If you prefer getting the printout in a json format
         -h : for help
        ```
        
        To run the program just use the command "john-resume":
        ```
        john-resume //Prints the resume
        john-resume -f //Prints the resume really fast
        ```
        
        Note that the script requires an interest connection, as this is an always online service.
