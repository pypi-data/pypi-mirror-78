def Mersmann_Kind_predictor(atoms, coeff=3.645, power=0.5, 
                            covalent_radii=rcovs_Mersmann_Kind):
    r'''Predicts the critical molar volume of a chemical based only on its
    atomic composition according to [18]_ and [19]_. This is a crude approach,
    but provides very reasonable
    estimates in practice. Optionally, the `coeff` used and the `power` in the
    fraction as well as the atomic contributions can be adjusted; this method
    is general and atomic contributions can be regressed to predict other
    properties with this routine.
    
    .. math::
        \frac{\left(\frac{V_c}{n_a N_A}\right)^{1/3}}{d_a}
        = \frac{3.645}{\left(\frac{r_a}{r_H}\right)^{1/2}}

        r_a = d_a/2
        
        d_a = 2 \frac{\sum_i (n_i r_i)}{n_a}
        
    In the above equations, :math:`n_i` is the number of atoms of species i in
    the molecule, :math:`r_i` is the covalent atomic radius of the atom, and 
    :math:`n_a` is the total number of atoms in the molecule.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : dict
        Dictionary of atoms and their counts, [-]
    coeff : float, optional
        Coefficient used in the relationship, [m^2]
    power : float, optional
        Power applied to the relative atomic radius, [-]
    covalent_radii : dict or indexable, optional
        Object which can be indexed to atomic contrinbutions (by symbol), [-]

    Returns
    -------
    Vc : float
        Predicted critical volume of the chemical, [m^3/mol]
    
    Notes
    -----    
    Using the :obj:`thermo.elements.periodic_table` covalent radii (from RDKit), 
    the coefficient and power should be 4.261206523632586 and 0.5597281770786228
    respectively for best results.
    
    Examples
    --------
    Prediction of critical volume of decane:
        
    >>> Mersmann_Kind_predictor({'C': 10, 'H': 22})
    0.0005851859052024729
    
    This is compared against the experimental value, 0.000624 (a 6.2% relative
    error)
    
    Using custom fitted coefficients we can do a bit better:
        
    >>> from thermo.critical import rcovs_regressed
    >>> Mersmann_Kind_predictor({'C': 10, 'H': 22}, coeff=4.261206523632586, 
    ... power=0.5597281770786228, covalent_radii=rcovs_regressed)
    0.0005956871011923075
    
    The relative error is only 4.5% now. This is compared to an experimental 
    uncertainty of 5.6%.
    
    Evaluating 1321 critical volumes in the database, the average relative
    error is 5.0%; standard deviation 6.8%; and worst value of 79% relative
    error for phosphorus.

### Critical Property Relationships


def Ihmels(Tc=None, Pc=None, Vc=None):
    r'''
    Most recent, and most recommended method of estimating critical
    properties from each other. Two of the three properties are required.
    This model uses the "critical surface", a general plot of Tc vs Pc vs Vc.
    The model used 421 organic compounds to derive equation.
    The general equation is in [20]_:

    .. math::
        P_c = -0.025 + 2.215 \frac{T_c}{V_c}

    Parameters
    ----------
    Tc : float, optional
        Critical temperature of fluid [K]
    Pc : float, optional
        Critical pressure of fluid [Pa]
    Vc : float, optional
        Critical volume of fluid [m^3/mol]

    Returns
    -------
    critical_point : CriticalPoint
        Critical point of the fluid [K], [Pa], and [m^3/mol]

    Notes
    -----
    The prediction of Tc from Pc and Vc is not tested, as this is not necessary

def Meissner(Tc=None, Pc=None, Vc=None):
    r'''Old (1942) relationship for estimating critical
    properties from each other. Two of the three properties are required.
    This model uses the "critical surface", a general plot of Tc vs Pc vs Vc.
    The model used 42 organic and inorganic compounds to derive the equation.
    The general equation is in [21]_:

    .. math::
        P_c = \frac{2.08 T_c}{V_c-8}

    Parameters
    ----------
    Tc : float, optional
        Critical temperature of fluid [K]
    Pc : float, optional
        Critical pressure of fluid [Pa]
    Vc : float, optional
        Critical volume of fluid [m^3/mol]

    Returns
    -------
    critical_point : CriticalPoint
        Critical point of the fluid [K], [Pa], and [m^3/mol]

    Notes
    -----
    The prediction of Tc from Pc and Vc is not tested, as this is not necessary
    anywhere, but it is implemented.
    Internal units are atm, cm^3/mol, and K. A slight error occurs when
    Pa, cm^3/mol and K are used instead, on the order of <0.2%.
    This equation is less accurate than that of Ihmels, but surprisingly close.
    The author also proposed means of estimated properties independently.
