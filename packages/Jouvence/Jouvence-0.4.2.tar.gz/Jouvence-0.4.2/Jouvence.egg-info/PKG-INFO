        `Fountain`_ is a plain text markup language for screenwriting. Jouvence
        is a Python package for parsing and rendering Fountain documents.
        
        Jouvence supports:
        
        * Most of the Fountain specification (see limitations below).
        * Rendering to HTML and terminals.

        Installation
        ============
        
        As with many Python packages, it's recommended that you use `virtualenv`_,
        but since Jouvence doesn't have many dependencies, you should be fine.
        
        You can install Jouvence the usual way::
        
          pip install jouvence
        
        If you want to test that it works, you can feed it a Fountain screenplay and
        see if it prints it nicely in your terminal::
        
          jouvence <path-to-fountain-file>
        
        You should then see the Fountain file rendered with colored and indented
        styles.

        Usage
        =====
        
        The Jouvence API goes pretty much like this::
        
          from jouvence.parser import JouvenceParser
          from jouvence.html import HtmlDocumentRenderer
        
          parser = JouvenceParser()
          document = parser.parse(path_to_file)
          renderer = HtmlDocumentRenderer()
          with open(path_to_output, 'w') as fp:
            renderer.render_doc(document, fp)
        
        
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        Jouvence doesn't support the complete Fountain syntax yet. The following things
        are not implemented:
        
        * Dual dialogue
        * Proper Unicode support (although Fountain's spec greatly assumes English screenplays, sadly).
