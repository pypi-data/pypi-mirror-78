# Xtesting

## Why Xtesting?


### Functest framework

- handle all interactions with OPNFV CI/CD components (entry points,
results publication, status codes, etc.)
- ease the development of third-party testcases by offering multiple drivers:
Python, Bash, unittest, Robot Framework and VNF.

**It has worked very well for E-release, but updates were required for
the next ones**


### Internal needs

- Functest has to verify Kubernetes deployment but
[its former framework](http://testresults.opnfv.org/functest/framework/) was
linked to OpenStack (e.g. credentials sourcing, rally verifiers, etc.)
- hosting both OpenStack and Kubernetes in the same Python package would
increase dependencies and then complexify
[container slicing](http://testresults.opnfv.org/functest/dockerslicing/)

**Why not refactoring the first Functest framework?**


### External needs

- Functest Python and containers framework could be very useful out of OPNFV
(ease developing testcases, manage requirements and offer lightweight Docker
images)
- a new Functest design could simplify test integration in a complete
[OPNFV-based CI/CD toolchain](http://docs.opnfv.org/en/stable-euphrates/testing/ecosystem/overview.html)
(e.g. Testing Containers, Test API and dashboard)

**Let the developer only work on the test suites without diving into CI/CD
integration**



## What's been done for Fraser?


### Xtesting framework

- Functest framework were moved to a new xtesting repository
(functest only hosts OpenStack testcases)
- it has been updated and improved to follow all Xtesting technical
guidelines:
  - unlink to **OpenStack** and **OPNFV**
  - support both Python2 and Python3 (required by **Functional Gating**)
  - be fully covered by unit tests and well rated by pylint (10/10)


### Xtesting deliverables

- Xtesting is released as [a Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xtesting/)
and then is unlinked to OPNFV Milestones (Functest Python package now depends
on it)
- [opnfv/xtesting](https://hub.docker.com/r/opnfv/xtesting/) is proposed to
build third-parties containers (both amd64 and arm64 architectures).
- the API documentation is automatically built
[online](http://xtesting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidoc/xtesting.html)

### first verify the infrastructure via Functest

### then run ONAP HealthCheck

- All tests are run by a specialized Docker container(**<100 MB**) instead of
the classical ONAP testing virtual machine (**> 1GB**).
- the container mainly inherits from opnfv/xtesting and is completed by:
  - Python dependencies
  - all ONAP Robot Framework files retrieved from the original repositories
  - testcases.yaml describing the testcases

## Conclusion


## Benefits

- Xtesting allows a proper design inside OPNFV
- Xtesting and Functest help other LFN projects:
  - verifying the infrastructure on top of which the components are deployed
  - ease verifying the components as well in the same CI/CD toolchain

  **All contributions coming from LFN projects are more than welcome!**
