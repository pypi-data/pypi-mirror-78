<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>wall</em> deck starring {{ card("Goratrix") }}.
    Its superior <i>I</i> allows him to use
    {{ card("Sense the Savage Way") }}, a powerful
    addition to the <i>A</i> intercept module.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Goratrix") }} combat ability is very good: as
    {{ card("Theft of Vitae") }}, its damage can not be prevented.
    The use of {{ card("Carrion Crows") }} for additional damage and
    {{ card("Canine Horde") }} against weapons makes for a powerful
    but slim combat module.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Magic of the Smith") }} is used to fetch powerful
    equipments adapted to the table context.
    {{ card("Heart of Nizchetus") }} is always good,
    {{ card("Bowl of Convergence") }} adds additional intercept,
    {{ card("Ivory Bow") }},
    {{ card("Kevlar Vest") }} and
    {{ card("Ruins of Ceoris") }} are great additions for combat.
</p>
<p>
    The intercept module is very heavy, with 20 wakes not counting the
    {{ card("Cats' Guidance") }}, 9 bleed bounces to help deliver
    pool damage to the prey, and a total of 45 bonus intercept available accross 45 reaction cards.
</p>
<p>
    Pool damage is done using
    {{ card("Anarch Revolt") }},
    {{ card("Army of Rats") }} and
    {{ card("Smiling Jack, The Anarch") }}, with the addition of
    {{ card("Enkil Cog") }} at some point to have
    {{ card("Goratrix") }} bleed for 3 at the end of its predator's turn
    if he is still unlocked.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Anarch Revolt") }} is ineffective if the prey gets
    <em>Anarch</em> vampires into play, but {{ card("Eagle's Sight") }}
    can be used to intercept these <em>Anarchs</em> whatever they do and dispose of them quickly.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The sidekicks in the crypt also have the <i>AI</i> disciplines combination to help with intercept in case
    a {{ card("Pentexâ„¢ Subversion") }} is played.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Rutor's Hand") }} and
    {{ card("Mylan Horseed") }} are used to enable
    {{ card("Goratrix") }} to act and still stay unlocked.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Villein") }} and
    {{ card("Vessel") }} are used to bloat a bit from
    {{ card("Goratrix") }}, as its combat ability should ensure he never
    runs out of blood.
</p>
<p>
    Given the disciplines span available to {{ card("Goratrix") }},
    {{ card("The Erciyes Fragments") }} becomes very versatile.
    It can provide additional wakes and bounces but also bleed enhancers.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are not many variants in this archetype.
    {{ card("Read the Winds") }}
    is often included in the intercept module, and surprise aggravated damage from <i>v</i> can be added, like
    {{ card("Breath of the Dragon") }} or
    {{ card("Chiropteran Marauder") }}.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to build a non-anarch version of this archetype. It looses the damages from
    {{ card("Anarch Revolt") }}, but gains access to
    {{ card("Abbot") }} and
    {{ card("Powerbase: Barranquilla") }}, like in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Jakub Baranowski's deck"), twda_id="2013pncnsp") }}
    from the 2013 Polish NC.
