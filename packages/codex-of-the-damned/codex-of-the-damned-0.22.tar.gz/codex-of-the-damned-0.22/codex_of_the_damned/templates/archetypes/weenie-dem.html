<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using the <i>eo</i> disciplines and middle to low capacity
    vampires. The idea is to bring maximum pool damage to the prey as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Stealth is very high, using {{ card("Confusion") }} and multiple <i>o</i>
    and <i>e</i> modifiers.
</p>
<p>
    Some vampires have <i>A</i>, so
    {{ card("Telepathic Misdirection") }} can be used against
    bleeds.
    {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }} and
    {{ card("Poison Pill") }} are used against votes.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Kindred Spirits") }} provides some bloat and
    {{ card("Madman's Quill") }} can be used for the lunge.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is very fast, but a bit fragile. There is no combat module, and a strong combat deck can
    become an issue. It is compensated by the fact the deck is fast.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Leverage") }} is used to keep the opponents guessing about
    the actual bleed power of the deck, adding just a point of bleed for an eventual lunge.
</p>
<p>
    The disciplines are not so well distributed in the crypt:
    {{ card("Obfuscate") }},
    {{ card("Dementation") }} and
    {{ card("Dive into Madness") }} can be used to fix this.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Dreams of the Sphinx") }} and
    {{ card("Heart of Nizchetus") }} help with cards rotation
    and avoid jamming the hand with stealth if the prey chooses not to block.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Poison Pill") }} is an interesting alternative to
    {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }} in a weenie
    deck: it does not cost a blood, which is better as blood is a rare resource in this deck,
    plus it is an excellent counter to high damage anti-weenie votes like
    {{ card("Anarchist Uprising") }},
    {{ card("Ancilla Empowerment") }} and
    {{ card("Domain Challenge") }}.
</p>
<p>
    Only one copy of each vampire in the crypt makes sure that each draw on the crypt will get a
    vampire that can be brought into play.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are many small variations of this archetype.
    {{ card("Restructure") }} (against ally),
    {{ card("Enchanted Marionette") }} and
    {{ card("Telepathic Counter") }}
    (because
    {{ card("Narrow Minds") }} can cripple
    {{ card("Telepathic Misdirection") }}
    )
    are sometimes included.
    More {{ card("Wash") }} and
    {{ card("Sudden Reversal") }} can be included,
    sometimes even {{ card("Bleeding The Vine") }},
    to counter Master bloat cards like {{ card("Villein") }} and
    improve the deck forward pressure.
</p>
<p>
    Bigger capacity vampires can be used like in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Norbert Br√≥da's deck"), twda_id="2015nliiibh") }} from 2015.
    A stable access to <i>O</i> and <i>A</i> gives them better stealth and let them use
    {{ card("The Call") }} and
    {{ card("No Trace") }} for combat defence,
    although the deck gets a bit slower.
</p>
<p>
    Lower capacity vampires can be used, dropping <i>o</i> entirely to rely exclusively on <i>E</i>,
    as in {{ link("/deck-search", _("Bram van Stappen's deck"), twda_id="2013gncbc") }} from the 2013 German NC.
    This is an even faster variation, but more fragile as the stealth gets lower and the vampires
    have more chances to get blocked.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, a more stable crypt can be used, like in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Pawel Kosz's"), twda_id="2011rtthbp") }} deck from 2011,
    but {{ card("Wider View") }} is included to help with crypt rotation
    in this case.
