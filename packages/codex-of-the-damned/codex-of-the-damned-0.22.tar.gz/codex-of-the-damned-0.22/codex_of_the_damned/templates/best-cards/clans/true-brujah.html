<h1><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-true-brujah.svg') }}"> True Brujah</h1>
<p>
    The True Brujah and their unique <i>?</i> discipline have some powerful vampires among their ranks.
    The use of {{ card("Summon History") }} to put vampires or
    allies into play fast and cheap has given birth to interesting decklists,
    like <a href="../../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2011sac">Fernando Grossi's deck</a> from 2011.
</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/domainofevernight.jpg">
        <h4>Domain of Evernight</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 58 decks, typically 1-8 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Often played for its additional stealth at inferior <i>o</i> outside of the clan,
        its <i>?</i> and <i>!</i> effects makes it a useful tool in virtually all True Brujah decks.
        Combined with {{ card("Outside the Hourglass") }},
        it forms the most dreadful combat combination of the game.
    </p>

<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/tabrizassembly.jpg">
        <h4>Tabriz Assembly</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 21 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A Hunting Ground giving +1 hand size at no cost is awesome,
        the fact that it is removable is not really an issue.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/tangleatroposhand.jpg">
        <h4>Tangle Atropos' Hand</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 20 decks, typically 1-5 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent stealth device at superior <i>!</i>, as it not only adds stealth but also tends to
        consume wakes on the opponents side. The <i>p</i> is useful when a bleed is bounced:
        a block attempt, even non succesful, allows it to cancel the action.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/outsidethehourglass.jpg">
        <h4>Outside the Hourglass</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 17 decks, typically 6-11 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A unique effect: combined with
        {{ card("Domain of Evernight") }} it can deliver
        aggravated damage <em>before</em> the strikes.
        Hard to prevent as it is not a strike, and oblivious to "combat ends", it can be combined
        with {{ card("Disarm") }} as it is not environmental.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/summonhistory.jpg">
        <h4>Summon History</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 16 decks, typically 3-9 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A unique effect both at inferior <i>?</i> and superior <i>!</i>.
        Combined with
        {{ card("The Ankara Citadel, Turkey") }},
        it can put allies and vampires into play for half the price.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/almuntathirgodswitness.jpg">
        <h4>Al-Muntathir, God's Witness</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 15 decks, typically 3-5 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The most played vampire of the clan, its superior <i>F</i>
        is often the reason of its presence in a crypt.
        As True Brujah are scarce, the ability to play
        {{ card("Freak Drive") }} is a good asset.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/clothosgift.jpg">
        <h4>Clotho's Gift</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 14 decks, typically 1-5 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Also used in <i>o</i> constructs to help get more vampires out of the crypt,
        its superior <i>!</i> effect is an obvious
        {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB") }} increase at a very cheap cost.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/vaticination.jpg">
        <h4>Vaticination</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 14 decks, typically 2-7 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent clan card: the +3 stealth bonus makes it virtually unblockable,
        and its effect is excellent at controlling the table. Both neighbours can quickly loose their
        bleed bounces or lunge cards, plus it can be used to deal across the table.
