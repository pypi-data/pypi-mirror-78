<h1><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-caitiff.svg') }}"> Caitiff</h1>
<p>
    Caitiff are rarely played on their own, but they often offer low capacity vampires
    that can complete crypts for other clans and builds.
    Now a clan, they were before considered as vampires without a clan:
    it explains why they have no library clan cards at all.

    <p>
        The most played Caitiff by far, he is an easy and relatively cheap way to make vampires Anarch,
        and can even be used to smooth crypt rotation a bit.

    </div>
    <p>
        Two disciplines for 1 pool is relatively cheap, moreoever her group makes her an easy inclusion.
        She is most often seen algonside other Caitiff in very fast crypts.

    </div>
    <p>
        Two disciplines for 1 pool is relatively cheap, he is often seen alongside
        {{ card("Antoinette DuChamp") }}.

    </div>
    <p>
        The oldest Caitiff, he is often seen alongside other titled Camarilla vampires.
        His <i>Ro</i> disciplines combination is a nice fit for political decks and his 7 pool cost
        is relatively low. A frequent companion of
        {{ card("Victor Pelletier") }}.

    </div>
    <p>
        Althouth his downside can be a real bummer, his low cost for <i>e</i> makes him a possible
        minclusion in very fast versions of the
        {{ link("/archetypes/weenie-dem", _("Weenie DEM")) }} archetype.
