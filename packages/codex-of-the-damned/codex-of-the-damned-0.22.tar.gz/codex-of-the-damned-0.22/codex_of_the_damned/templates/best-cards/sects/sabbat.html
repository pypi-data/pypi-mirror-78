<h1>Sabbat</h1>
<p>
    The Sabbat is the second sect to have been published in the game, after the Camarilla.
    It offers good alternatives to its members, especially concerning blocking capabilities.
</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/abbot.jpg">
        <h4>Abbot</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 175 decks, typically 1-2 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent intercept enhancer that does not even cost an action,
        although only against directed actions. Virtually every Sabbat wall deck include some of these.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/blackforestbase.jpg">
        <h4>Black Forest Base</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 45 decks, typically 1-2 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent bloat device for Sabbat decks that have the votes to back it up,
        it can also be used as a bargaining ship with other Methusalahs.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/undersiege.jpg">
        <h4>Under Siege</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 44 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent defensive tool for titled Sabbat vampires, to be compared with the Camarilla's
        {{ card("Second Tradition: Domain") }},
        It needs to get through to be used and provides less intercept, but three unlocks for just
        one pool is a bargain.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/eternalvigilance.jpg">
        <h4>Eternal Vigilance</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 42 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Another good defensive device that provides an unlock on every action, it can be combined
        with {{ card("Abbot") }}
        and {{ card("Under Siege") }}
        for an exceptional defensive arsenal.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/yawpcourt.jpg">
        <h4>Yawp Court</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 29 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A powerful defensive tool for combat-oriented decks, it can deter any political predator.
        Most often associated with {{ card("Tupdogs") }},
        it can also find its place in other Sabbat decks.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/cardinalbenediction.jpg">
        <h4>Cardinal Benediction</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 25 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good title worth three votes that Camarilla titled vampires cannot counter easily.
        It is a worthwile addition in political decks if the crypt allows it.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/rumble.jpg">
        <h4>Rumble</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 18 decks, typically 1-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A decent rush action, its effect is useful for a bit of additional cycling,
        something combat-oriented decks often prize.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/privateaudience.jpg">
        <h4>Private Audience</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 13 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good modifier for political actions, as it can neutralize many adversary votes around the table
        single-handedly.
    </p>
