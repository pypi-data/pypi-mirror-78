<h1>Camarilla</h1>
<p>
    The Camarilla is the first sect (publication-wise), and it offers
    unique and powerful tools to its members, especially when it comes to politics.

<h2>Highlights</h2>

        <h4>Parity Shift</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 340 decks, typically 2-6 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        One of the best vote available with its -3/+3 pool effect.
        It was even more powerful before the september 2019 <em>errata</em>, when the score would equal
        the number of Methusalah in play, for a devastating -5/+5 effect early game.

        <h4>Second Tradition: Domain</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 276 decks, typically 3-9 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Only available for Princes and Justicars, it is one of the most effective reaction of the game.
        Not only does it unlock — not just wake — the vampire, it also provides a solid +2 intercept bonus.
        Furthermore, the reasonable blood cost of one is only paid when the unlock effect is needed.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 47 decks, typically 1-5 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Although only available for Justicars and Inner Circles, this vote let them fetch costly equipment
        at a bargain, like an {{ card("Helicopter") }} or an
        {{ card("Assault Rifle") }}.
        Combined with a strong weapon, the option to enter combat becomes dreadful.

        <h4>Judgment: Camarilla Segregation</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 32 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A decent pool damaging action, although more efficient votes like
        {{ card("Kine Resources Contested") }}
        are often preferred, it can also find its place in non-political decks.
        It can account to a serious overall amount if played early enough.

        <h4>Fourth Tradition: The Accounting</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 29 decks, typically 1-5 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Reserved to Princes and Justicars as all traditions, this one helps getting more vampires out
        faster and cheaper, a useful asset for those who do not have access to the more versatile
        {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }}.

        <h4>First Tradition: The Masquerade</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 27 decks, typically 1-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Reserved to Princes and Justicars as all traditions, it can stack and lock down a table pretty
        quickly provided one has enough blood to pay for it. The obvious drawback is that it can quickly
        focus a lot of table hatred on the MEthusalah who played it.

    </div>
    <p>
        Some Praxis give a capacity bonus to a specific clan. The Brujah one is slightly more played
        because they have powerful cards for their Princes like
        {{ card("New Carthage") }} and
        {{ card("Carthage Remembered") }}.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 22 decks, typically 1-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A powerful bloat device, although a bit tricky to land: one needs both the stealth and votes
        to get it through, and a combat module strong enough to trigger it. A vote most often seen played
        by the Brujah.
