<h1><i>d</i> Dominate</h1>
<div class="tip">
    <p>
        <i>d</i> is the most played discipline of the game. It provides an excellent bleed module,
        good bloat and the best bounce in the game. <strong>More than a third</strong>
        of winning decks use this discipline.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 880 decks, typically 3-8 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        It is the best bounce of the game. At superior <i>D</i>,
        it can be chained multiple times by the same vampire,
        an incredibly effective defence against even the most severe bleed constructs.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 649 decks, typically 2-6 copies</p>

    <p>
        It is the best bleed modifier of the game, and can be associated with
        {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }}
        for a 6-pool bleed. The ability to use this modifier only after blocks have been declined
        makes it superior to bleed actions. The 1 blood cost is a bargain.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 641 decks, typically 4-11 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An incredibly versatile tool, it helps getting more vampires out for cheap
        in the beginning of the game,
        and provides an excruciating bleed later on.

        Clearly it dos not have the same impact as
        {{ card("Conditioning") }} in terms of pool damage,
        but the +1 stealth is invaluable for constructs with no alternative discipline for stealth.

        An excellent block denial modifier. Well targeted,
        it can be enough to get a bleed through unopposed.
        Combined with another block denial modifier, it allows for a pure block denial module
        that can be used to get actions through without even bothering to use stealth.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 229 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent lunge device, it has the same pool damage as a
        {{ card("Conditioning") }} at no cost,
        provided the prey is low enough in pool.
        Having both modifiers in hand can be a good way to get around a
        {{ card("Direct Intervention") }}, as the modifier
        countered this way can not be used again during the same action, but another can.

        An alternative to {{ card("Deflection") }} with no cost,
        it is only used when <i>D</i> is always at superior in the crypt.
        Even then, {{ card("Deflection") }} is still often preferred
        because it can be chained multiple times.

    <p>
        An excellent action to get rid of cumbersome retainers and, more importantly, allies.
        The 1 blood cost is a bargain.
