<h1><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-malkavian.svg') }}"> Malkavian</h1>
<p>
    The Malkavian are a prominent clan. With their unique <i>e</i> discipline and the excellent
    <i>oa</i> disciplines aside, plus some really good vampires, they have led to many
    archetypes.
    {{ link("/archetypes/lutz-politics", _("Lutz Politics")) }} and
    {{ link("/archetypes/rachel-madness", _("Rachel Madness")) }} are two archetypes revolving around
    the powerful vampires
    {{ card("Lutz von Hohenzollern") }} and
    {{ card("Rachel Brandywine") }} respectively.
    On the other hand, the Malkavian and their antitribu are also used into two strong weenie constructs:
    {{ link("/archetypes/weenie-dem", _("Weenie DEM")) }} and
    {{ link("/archetypes/weenie-aus", _("Weenie AUS")) }}.
</p>
<p>
    Group 1 Malkavian have the <i>doa</i> disciplines combination, making them the only vampires
    of the game with <i>do</i> as clan disciplines.
    That got them into other archetypes, like the
    {{ link("/archetypes/mind-rape", _("Mind Rape")) }} archetype, using
    {{ card("Mind Rape") }} to take control of opponents vampires.
    Malkavian and their antitribu got <i>e</i> instead of <i>d</i> since group 2, an evolution right on
    tracks
    with the roleplaying game <em>Vampire: the Masquerade</em>.

        This bleed action is central to the <i>e</i> discipline.
        It can deliver a bleed of 2 in combination with a 1 pool bloat.
        Moreover, the bleed can be directed to any Methusalah, not only the prey, offering additional table
        control.

    <p>
        Star of the Malkavian clan, he has a really powerful ability, 4 votes and +2 bleed like many
        Inner Circle, combined with all clan disciplines plus the useful <i>R</i> that gives acces to
        excellent
        vote modifiers like {{ card("Voter Captivation") }}.

        Superior <i>A</i> at 3 pool is really a bargain. She has access to
        {{ card("Telepathic Misdirection") }} for the
        cheapest
        price.

    </div>
    <p>
        A good stealth enhancer at superior <i>E</i>, its inferior ability is seldom used but can still
        come in handy to get out of a {{ card("Trap") }}, for example.

    <p>
        A rare effect for this infamous clan card. It enables Malkavians to stay in defence and
        only bleed at the end of their predator's turn, but it can also be used to act multiple
        times during the successive turns of other players.
        I can become a cornerstone of the deck when combined with other tricks, like
        {{ card("Homunculus") }} or
        {{ card("Reversal of Fortunes") }}.

        5 pool is a good price for the <i>Eo</i> combination. He is almost always paired with

        in stealth & bleed constructs.

        A <em>Justicar</em> with a very powerful ability she can use <em>multiple times</em> during an
        action.
        She gets included even in other clans crypts just for her ability and title.

    <p>
        3 pool is a low price to pay for the <i>Eo</i> combination.
        Its <em>Infernal</em> trait is a bummer, but he is still excellent for stealth & bleed constructs,
        where speed matters more than cost. It can also bloat with
        {{ card("Kaymakli Fragment") }},
        which he can fetch with
        {{ card("Sibyl's Tongue") }}.

    <p>
        The only card in the game that can counter <i>d</i> bounces like
        {{ card("Deflection") }}: depending on the environment,
        it can be a powerful device in the <i>e</i> arsenal when used sparingly.

        A <em>Prince</em> for 7 pool with a good disciplines combination. He is group 3, the same group as
        {{ card("Maris Streck") }} and is often included alongside
        her.
        The fact that he can use
        {{ card("The Call") }} and

        Although he does not have superior <i>E</i>, his superior <i>R</i> and title makes him a natural

        +1 stealth for 1 blood: this is expensive. It is included in decks where <i>o</i> is not much
        available.
        Alongside {{ card("Deny") }} and

        An excellent ally remover at superior <i>E</i>. It can get rid of the widespread
