<h1><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-kiasyd.svg') }}"> Kiasyd</h1>
<p>
    The Kiasyd and their unique <i>x</i> discipline are quite close to the Lasombra,
    so they've been included in <em>Lasombra</em> deck as additional vampires, but also led to an archetype
    of their own, the
    {{ link("/archetypes/kiasyd-stealth-bleed", _("Kiasyd Stealth & Bleed")) }}.
    Compared to the Lasombra, <i>x</i> provides more bleed and stealth options
    and less combat options than <i>p</i>.

        <h4>Dame Hollerton</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 70 decks, typically 1-2 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A solid <i>£D</i> combination for just 5 pool, she is even often included in
        Lasombra <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-lasombra.svg') }}"> decks.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
        All clan disciplines at superior <i>£DX</i> for just 6 pool, he also has a rare ability that can
        provide
        an additional Master action. He sometimes get included in decks for this ability alone.

    </div>
    <p>
        It is included in most Kiasyd decks and even in Lasombra + Kiasyd mixes as it can also be used at
        <i>$</i>.
        Additional stealth from <i>x</i> is one of the main point of using Kiasyd instead of Lasombra.

        <h4>Great Symposium</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 37 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Often included when playing four or more Kiasyds in the crypt — it has no burn option and can jam
        the hand
        if no Kiasyd is out yet. This is a 3 pool bloat, a high value for a Master card.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 31 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good disciplines combination at a reasonable price — she is often included in Kiasyd only crypts.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 33 decks, typically 2-6 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The intercept feature can come in handy in some cases,
        but this card is mostly used for yet another source of stealth

        <h4>Fae Contortion</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 32 decks, typically 3-7 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Yet another stealth source, with a combat option that can come in handy in certain constructs.
        The ability to cancel an {{ card("Immortal Grapple") }}
        can save a vampire, even if it is not the main point of the card.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 29 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Good disciplines combination and an excellent ability in pure Kiasyd crypts, for a very
        reasonnable 7 pool.

        <h4>Roderick Phillips March</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 29 decks, typically 1-2 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good disciplines combination for pure Kiasyd crypts, although his ability is rarely used.

        <h4>The Arcadian</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 27 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Although a bit expensive with his 8 pool cost, he has all clan disciplines at superior and
        an excellent ability that let him deliver deadlier bleeds to the prey.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/gremlins.jpg">

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 25 decks, typically 1-6 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Not used in all Kiasyd constructs, as <i>d</i> gives access to better bleed actions,
        its +1 stealth bonus can still be the cornerstone of a stealth & bleed strategy.
        Combined with {{ card("Bonding") }}, it results in a solid
        3 bleed and 2 stealth action.
    </p>

<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/songofpan.jpg">
        <h4>Song of Pan</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 25 decks, typically 2-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A nice boost for a lunge move, it is a classic inclusion for pure Kiasyd decks.
        Again, the lack of a burn option makes it difficult to include in mixed Lasombra decks.
