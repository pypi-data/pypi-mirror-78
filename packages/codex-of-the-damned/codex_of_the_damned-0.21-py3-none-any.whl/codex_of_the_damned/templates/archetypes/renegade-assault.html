<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>rush</em> deck using {{ card("Renegade Garou") }}
    and low capacity <i>j</i> vampires to take down other minions around the table.
    {{ card("Tribute to the Master") }} is used to bloat and
    naked bleed actions are used to deliver pool damage to the prey.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module is strong and heavy, and
    {{ card("Target Vitals") }} and
    {{ card("Weighted Walking Stick") }} can be used
    indistinctively by vampires or werewolves. {{ card("Fame") }} is used
    for additional pool damage on the prey.
<p>
    If {{ card("Jacob Fermor") }} gets into play, werewolves
    see their bleed boosted, which can be nice for the lunge.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("The Unmasking") }} transform the werewolves into
    good blockers, which is always nice defensively.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Poison Pill") }} is an alternative to
    {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }}: it costs less blood and
    can disable a damage dealing vote like {{ card("Reins of Power") }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Direct Intervention") }} is a very effective counter
    against anti-ally actions like {{ card("Entrancement") }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Earth Meld") }} is an effective combat defence to protect
    the low capacity vampires.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The main variant includes more copies of {{ card("Jacob Fermor") }}
    and {{ card("Renegade Garou") }} to make the most of the core
    combination of the deck.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Antti Tiril√§'s deck"), twda_id="2k9alastorsvilleins") }}
    from 2009 is a good example.
    It also includes {{ card("Dragonbound") }} and
    {{ card("Camera Phone") }} to enhance pool damage.
