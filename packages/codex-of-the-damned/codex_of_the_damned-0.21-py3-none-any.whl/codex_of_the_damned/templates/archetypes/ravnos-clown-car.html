<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>breed & boon</em> deck using the Ravnos clan.
    Low capacity Ravnos use {{ card("Mozambique Allure") }}
    to become Laibon, then multiply with
    {{ card("The Embrace") }} and
    {{ card("Bamba") }}, paying them with
    {{ card("Ravnos Carnival") }} and
    using {{ card("The Eldest Are Kholo") }} with
    {{ card("Consanguineous Boon") }} to bloat.
</p>
<p>
    When enough minions are out,
    the {{ card("Week of Nightmares") }} gets into play
    and all these Ravnos bleed their prey to death, one after the other.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("The Uncoiling") }} is a tactical counter against
    {{ card("Scourge of the Enochians") }}, as this event
    is often included in slow decks as a counter against breed constructs like this one.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Gird Minions") }} help get the minions back in shape
    if the bloat works well enough, in order to produce yet another wave of neonates.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Life Boon") }} is also a way to control the table a bit if
    the bloat goes well enough. The deck usually does not put that much pressure on its prey until
    {{ card("Week of Nightmares") }} hits the table,
    so this can compensate a bit.
</p>
<p>
    The deck does not try to block its predator, counting on its bloat to compensate.
    {{ card("Aranthebes, The Immortal") }} is included
    only as a counter to contest it if anyone gets to put it into play, as it is too damaging to this deck.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Autarkis Persecution") }} is included as a hail mary
    if one gets stuck with low pool and someone uses
    {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }} against
    {{ card("Consanguineous Boon") }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are not many variants for this archetype.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Miguel Pascual's deck"), twda_id="2k8powerbasecataluna") }} in 2008
    has experimented with {{ card("Rom Gypsy") }}
    to provide an additional bit of stealth and defence.
