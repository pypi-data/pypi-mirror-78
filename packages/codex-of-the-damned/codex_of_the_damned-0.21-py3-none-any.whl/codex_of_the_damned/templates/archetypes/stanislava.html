<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth vote & bleed</em> deck with
    {{ card("Stanislava") }} as a star. She uses
    {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }} to help get other
    vampires out and {{ card("Villein") }} is used to get some pool
    back. The second vampire should be a <em>Prince</em>,
    preferrably {{ card("Ingrid Rossler") }},
    to be able to play the numerous {{ card("Parity Shift") }}.
</p>
<p>
    As the game progresses, more big capacity titled vampires get out and
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }} is used both to deliver pool damage and to
    bloat. Vampires begin to bleed, using <i>j</i> for stealth with
    {{ card("Form of Mist") }},
    {{ card("Earth Control") }} and
    {{ card("Rapid Change") }}.
<p>
    {{ card("Deflection") }} is used for bleed defence, with some
    {{ card("Sense the Savage Way") }} to unlock if need be.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Forced March") }} and
    {{ card("Instantaneous Transformation") }} are
    extremely versatile as they can be used both for stealth or additional action, allowing a vampire
    to bleed and call a vote in the same turn.
    {{ card("Stanislava") }} can use both,
    but some other vampires in the crypt can use one or the other.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Murmur of the False Will") }} can be used
    both for bounces and bleed enhancement, depending on the context. However, they're not supposed to be used
    with {{ card("Stanislava") }} herself, as bleeding for more than 3
    would expose her to {{ card("Archon Investigation") }},
    a chance one would be wary to take with this deck.
</p>
<p>
    A <em>Prince</em> is required, not only for the
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }}, but also for
    {{ card("Papillon") }}, an excellent device to bring some blood
    back on the vampires. {{ card("Jake Washington") }} is also a very
    efficient tool to that effect.
</p>
<p>
    The {{ card("Seal of Veddartha") }} is an excellent
    equipment with this crypt, as most vampires miss either <i>D</i> or <i>F</i>. The +1 bleed bonus is nothing
    to cast aside either.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The archetype is very much known for <em>Martin Weinmayer's</em> build as he as been very successful with it
    and retained the top seat in the international classment for some years.
    The cards proportions may vary a little bit, some like to play some
    {{ card("Guard Dogs") }},
    {{ card("Kine Resources Contested") }},
    {{ card("Vele's Hunt") }} and/or
    {{ card("Claws of the Dead") }}.
    {{ card("Ecoterrorists") }} is also a common inclusion.
    Some alterations have been seen in the crypt too, like ditching
    {{ card("Rachel Brandywine") }} for an additional
    {{ card("Ingrid Rossler") }} or including
    {{ card("Iliana") }} or
    {{ card("Caitlin") }},
    as they have excellent disciplines combination for a low pool,
    although no title to support the political side of the deck.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Janne LÃ¶nnqvist's deck"), twda_id="2016rfehf") }} from 2016 is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Old School</strong> variant uses groups 1 and 2 in the crypt instead of the group 2-3 used here.
    It provides {{ card("Angus the Unruled") }} and
    {{ card("Don Cruez, The Idealist") }},
    two justicars with a nice sets of disciplines. It allows for more Royalty cards like
    {{ card("Second Tradition: Domain") }} and
    {{ card("Fourth Tradition: The Accounting") }}.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Giulio De Cicco's deck"), twda_id="2014gtdtigi") }} from 2014 is a good example.
