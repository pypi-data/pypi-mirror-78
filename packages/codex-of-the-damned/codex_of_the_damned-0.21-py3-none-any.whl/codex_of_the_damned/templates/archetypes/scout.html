<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>Vote</em> deck using {{ card("Scout Youngwood") }}
    for her <i>MORf</i> disciplines and unique access to
    {{ card("Shattering Crescendo") }},
    {{ card("Lily Prelude") }} and
    {{ card("Reckless Agitation") }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Villein") }} and
    {{ card("Zillah's Valley") }} are used to get more vampires
    out fast and cheap.
<p>
    The deck has serious stealth, with most vampires having <i>O</i>, and plays
    {{ card("Heart of the City") }} to enhance the bleed
    in the late game.
</p>
<p>
    As all vampires except {{ card("Scout Youngwood") }} are
    <em>Princes</em> and <em>Justicars</em>,
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }}
    is heavily used both for pool damages and bloat.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Dmitra Ilyanova") }}'s ability is a great way
    to get more blood on the table for those {{ card("Villein") }} and
    {{ card("Reckless Agitation") }}.
</p>
<p>
    With only 5 votes amoung its two star vampires, the deck can struggle to get the vote lock against
    other political constructs. Hence the inclusion of
    {{ card("Legendary Vampire") }},
    {{ card("Bewitching Oration") }} and
    {{ card("Perfect Paragon") }} to get critical votes through.
    If the pool allows it and she is drawn, getting
    {{ card("Arishat") }} out is a good way to handle an Inner Circle, too.
</p>
<p>
    Combat is purely defensive and uses only {{ card("Majesty") }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The archetype is seldom played and not many variations exist.
    Using a different crypt around can allow for different plays, for example
    using {{ card("Unmada") }} and
    {{ card("Benjamin Rose") }} for <i>A</i> and the excellent
    {{ card("Telepathic Misdirection") }} bounce.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Djordje Bjelajac's deck"), twda_id="2011ecfcq") }}
    from the 2011 EC FCQ is a good example of that.
