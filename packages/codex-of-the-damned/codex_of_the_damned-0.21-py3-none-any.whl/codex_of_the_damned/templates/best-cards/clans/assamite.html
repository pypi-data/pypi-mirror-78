<h1><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-assamite.svg') }}"> Assamite</h1>
<p>
    Assamite and their unique <i>q</i> discipline provide some good clan cards
    and multiple strategies usually revolving around <i>o</i> for stealth.
    This clan has four main archetypes:
<ul>
    <li>
        {{ link("/archetypes/amaravati-politics", _("Amaravati politics")) }},
        a political archetype with {{ card("Amaravati") }}.
    </li>
    <li>
        The {{ link("/archetypes/death-star", _("Death Star")) }},
        an anarch politics archetype.
    </li>
    <li>
        The {{ link("/archetypes/black-hand", _("Black Hand")) }} swarm archetype, from which
        the Asssamite variation is the most common.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ link("/archetypes/dmitris-big-band", _("Dimitri's Big Band")) }}, a toolbox archetype
        using
        {{ card("Dmitri Borodin") }} and the <i>ACQ</i>
        disciplines
        combination.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

        <h4>Haqim's Law: Leadership</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 28 decks, typically 3-9 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good action card for bloating. Assamite decks are rare, and most of them built around breeding.
        This action makes good use of the many low capacity Assamites one can have in this context.
        Even just a few copies already make for a good bloat.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 28 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A bleed enhancer with a 4 pool bloat bonus if timely played.
        Most Assamite decks include one or two of these for the lunge.

        <h4>Yoruba Shrine</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 26 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent defence against rush actions, but also against
        {{ card("Banishment") }},
        an all-too-common option in big capacity vote decks. The cost of 1 pool is fairly low.
    </p>

    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/alamut.jpg">
        <h4>Alamut</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 24 decks, typically 1-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent vote enhancer at a fair cost for any archetype.
        It is played for additional votes in political decks,
        but also as a defensive tool against political actions in other decks.
    </p>

        <h4>The Black Throne</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 18 decks, typically 1-2 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Another cheap vote enhancer, 2 votes for 1 pool is quite worth it. The contract part of the card
        is seldom used.

        <h4>Web of Knives Recruit</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 18 decks, typically 3-6 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An interesting breeding card: it is a bit slow as the new vampire only comes out after 3 turns but,
        on the other hand, the neonate has the three clan disciplines <i>qoc</i> at basic level and three
        blood,
        all for the low cost of 1 pool.

        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/amaravati.jpg">
        <h4>Amaravati</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 17 decks, typically 2-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The star of the {{ link("/archetypes/amaravati-politics", _("Amaravati Politics")) }} archetype,
        combined with {{ card("Web of Knives Recruit") }},
        {{ card("Alamut") }} and
        {{ card("The Black Throne") }},
        he builds up a strong vote lock.
        Moreover, his superior <i>D</i> gets him bounce reactions like
        {{ card("Deflection") }}.

<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/djuhahthebronzebow.jpg">
        <h4>Djuhah, The Bronze Bow</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 11 decks, typically 2-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        One of the best Seraph of the game, Djuhah also has good company in his clan as 5 Black Hand
        Assamite are available in groups 4 and 5. This led to the Assamite variation of the
        {{ link("/archetypes/black-hand", _("Black Hand")) }} swarm archetype.

<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">

        <h4>Market Square</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 11 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent permanent intercept at low cost. Used in all Assamite decks when blocking is an option.
        Swarm builds have no use for it though.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/loss.jpg">
        <h4>Loss</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 26 decks, typically 3-10 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A strong bleed action, played in most Assamite decks.
        The inferior <i>q</i> option can also come in handy.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/blacksunrise.jpg">
        <h4>Black Sunrise</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 21 decks, typically 2-8 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent reaction, which actually unlocks - not just wake - the vampire.
        This can be better as the vampire stays unlocked if he fails to block the action,
        but being forced to block can be tricky if the goal is to bounce a bleed.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="https://images.krcg.org/tasteofdeath.jpg">
        <h4>Taste of Death</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 13 decks, typically 1-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Worth mentioning as it is the most played <i>q</i> combat card, it is still hard to include
        as excellent range management is necessary to make it work.
        {{ card("Selective Silence") }} is a good option,
        but two cards and two blood is a high price to pay for it.
