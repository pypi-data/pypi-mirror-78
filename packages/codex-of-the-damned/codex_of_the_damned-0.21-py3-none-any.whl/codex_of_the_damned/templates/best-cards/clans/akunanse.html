<h1><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-akunanse.svg') }}"> Akunanse</h1>
<p>
    Akunanse and their rare <i>w</i> discipline provide a stronger defense than the usual <i>i</i> builds.
</p>
<p>
    This clan has two main archetypes: the {{ link("/archetypes/akunanse-wall", _("Akunanse Wall")) }},
    using <i>w</i> along <i>i</i> for a sturdy wall,
    and {{ link("/archetypes/team-jacob", _("Team Jacob")) }} using the infamous
    {{ card("Tunnel Runner") }}.
    More combat-oriented builds are limited due to the inability to deal with
    {{ link("/strategy/combat", _("combat ends"), _anchor="defense") }}.
</p>

    <p>
        A Magaji with superior <i>WFI</i> for just 7 pool: definitely a good deal.
        Her ability may be useful in tense situations, although 1 blood to draw a card is a high price to
        pay.
        The fact that she is Magaji let her play the excellent
        {{ card("No Secrets From the Magaji") }}.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 22 decks, typically 1-2 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good master for Akunanse decks: it can speed up the setup in the beginning,
        but also avoid pool loss regularly, at no cost.
        Gaining one or two turns or 3 pools or more is definitely efficient,
        it encourages the inclusion of low capacity vampires to get the edge sooner.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 14 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good equipment: a permanent +1 bleed for 1 pool is good,
        plus the discipline boost is excellent for low capacity vampires.

        <h4>Tunnel Runner</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 13 decks, typically 3-8 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        He can be used as the main minion of the deck for good stealthed bleeds,
        his ability can be used more than once in a turn, allowing it to get +2 stealth.
        He is expensive, though â€” he becomes really efficient partnered with
        {{ card("Jacob Fermor") }} in the
        {{ link("/archetypes/team-jacob", _("Team Jacob")) }} archetype.

    </div>
    <p>
        Wake and intercept bundled in a single card: an excellent reaction for any intercept module.
        This card, combined with the combat-efficient <i>f</i> discipline of the clan,
        explains the success of wall archetypes in the Akunanse clan.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 21 decks, typically 4-8 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good combat card at no cost: additional damage, plus a handy press that combines very well with
        {{ card("Carrion Crows") }}

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 20 decks, typically 3-7 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An easy to cycle stealth card, and the only one available for Akunanse.
        The superior effect may come in handy against weenie constructs.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 15 decks, typically 3-8 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good combat card, adding aggravated damage to an already efficient combat module.
        The strength bonus of {{ card("Invoking the beast") }}
        applies to it and the press at superior <i>W</i> can be deadly when used alongside
        {{ card("Carrion Crows") }}.
        Finally, it works with a hand strike, so
        {{ card("Immortal Grapple") }} is useless against it.
