<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>special</em> deck using {{ card("Madness Network") }}
    and {{ card("Reversal of Fortunes") }}.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to get some low capacity Malkavians out fast together with a
    {{ card("Madness Network") }},
    then play {{ card("Reversal of Fortunes") }}
    during the prey's turn to play again, then again on the predator's turn to play again, etc.
    playing twice as much as the opponents.
</p>
<p>
    The first vampires get a bit locked in the combination, and the rest of the deck focuses on playing a lot
    of Master cards,
    {{ card("Brainwash") }} and
    {{ card("Kaymakli Nightmares") }} to prevent the opponents
    of even getting a vampire out.
</p>
<p>
    The deck then kills with simple bleeds and
    {{ card("Smiling Jack, The Anarch") }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Rotation is tricky in this deck, and
    {{ card("Dreams of the Sphinx") }},
    {{ card("Specialization") }} and
    {{ card("Heart of Nizchetus") }}
    all help in this regard.
</p>
<p>
    Although {{ card("Victor Pelletier") }} is not a Malkavian,
    his ability is priceless in this deck, as
    {{ card("Reversal of Fortunes") }}
    needs some votes to get through.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are not many variants of this deck.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Orian Gissler's deck"), twda_id="2k9battlefrenzypf") }} from 2009
    was the original attempt.
