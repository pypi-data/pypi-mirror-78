<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>rush</em> deck using multiple {{ card("War Ghoul") }}
    to rush the opponents vampires.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to get a {{ card("War Ghoul") }} into play
    as soon as possible, using a low capacity Tzimisce and
    {{ card("Jake Washington") }}.
    The {{ card("War Ghoul") }} then proceeds to taking down every vampire
    on the table, using
    {{ card("Fake Out") }} and
    {{ card("Trap") }} as needed.
</p>
<p>
    Other allies and retainers can be recruited to be sacrificed to more
    {{ card("War Ghouls") }}.
    {{ card("Ossian") }}, if he is drawn, may even be better than a
    {{ card("War Ghoul") }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses low capacity vampires with <i>A</i> to bounce bleeds and intercept.
    Pool damage is done with {{ card("Dragonbound") }}
    and naked bleed once all the prey's vampires are down.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    This a fast and aggressive deck and will likely attract the table attention.
    It should try to keep control of the whole table if possible.
</p>
<p>
    Letting some vampires live on the predator side can be a good way to bounce their bleed and deliver additional
    pool damage to the prey.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Maris</strong> variant uses {{ card("Maris streck") }} for
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }} and
    {{ card("Anathema") }}.
    Check {{ link("/deck-search", _("Emiliano Imeroni's deck"), twda_id="2012bnc") }} from the 2012 Belgian NC.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Piper</strong> variant is an anarch version using
    {{ card("Anarch Convert") }} and
    {{ card("Piper") }} in order to bring
    {{ card("War Ghoul") }} into play unopposed, as in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Antonio Cobo Cuenca's deck"), twda_id="2k8parisncq") }} from 2008.
