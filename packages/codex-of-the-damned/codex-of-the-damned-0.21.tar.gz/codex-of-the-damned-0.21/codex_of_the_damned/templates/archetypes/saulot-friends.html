<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>wall</em> deck starring
    {{ card("Saulot, The Wanderer") }} and
    {{ card("The Capuchin") }}, with some sidekicks having the
    <i>AF</i> disciplines
</p>
<p>
    They all get <em>Anarch</em> using {{ card("Anarch Convert") }},
    and that allows them to use good <em>Anarch</em> cards like
    {{ card("Anarch Revolt") }},
    {{ card("The Anarch Free Press") }},
    {{ card("Monkey Wrench") }} and
    {{ card("Guardian Vigil") }}.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to block problematic actions both from the prey and the predator,
    using <i>A</i> for intercept, weapons and <i>F</i> for damage prevention in combat.
    The deck slowly builds up a strong position and delivers some well-timed bleeds to the prey.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Anarch Revolt") }} and
    {{ card("Smiling Jack, The Anarch") }} help
    improve pool damage, and {{ card("Monkey Wrench") }}
    can be used for the lunge.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Sire's Index Finger") }} is a good counter
    against {{ card("Deep Song") }} at superior and
    {{ card("RÃ¶tschreck") }}, but also against <i>i</i> frenzy
    cards commonly played against weapons:
    {{ card("Drawing Out the Beast") }} and
    {{ card("Terror Frenzy") }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("The Rack") }} is very strong in combination with
    {{ card("Saulot, The Wanderer") }}'s ability: together,
    they make for a nice bloat.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Hidden Strength") }} is a good way to prevent
    aggravated damage, but also to prevent the opponent to use damage-based cards like
    {{ card("Taste of Vitae") }} and
    {{ card("Disarm") }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are not many variants for this archetype. The <em>Anarch</em> option is rarely used,
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Daniel Abreu's deck"), twda_id="2016tdspb") }} from 2016 is a good example
    of doing it without the <em>Anarch</em> tech.
