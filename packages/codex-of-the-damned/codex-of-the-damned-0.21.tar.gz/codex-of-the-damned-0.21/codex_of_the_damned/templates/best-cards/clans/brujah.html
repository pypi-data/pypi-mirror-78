<h1><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-brujah.svg') }}"> Brujah</h1>
<p>
    Brujah and their antitribu have some vampires with excellent abilities and
    good clan cards. Their <i>rpc</i> disciplines combination give them access to excellent
    combat options (hindered by lack of damage prevention) and good political tricks.
    The most played archetype for the clan is the
    {{ link("/archetypes/euro-brujah", _("Euro Brujah")) }}, using Brujah princes with <i>d</i>.
    The antitribu, especially with {{ card("Armin Brenner") }},
    gave birth to interesting vote constructs, too.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 71 decks, typically 1-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Her Justicar title combined with <i>R</i>, <i>o</i> and a good political ability
        makes her an excellent tool in many Camarilla vote constructs.
        Her access to <i>F</i> also gives her the ability to play
        {{ card("Forced March") }} for additional actions.
        She is definitely the star of the clan.

        Volker is one of the cheapest Prince around, and he finds its place in many Camarilla Royalty
        constructs.
        Its superior <i>C</i> also makes him a good asset in other <i>C</i> constructs â€”
        he founds an easy place in Toreador {{ link("/archetypes/aaa", _("AAA")) }} archetype for
        example.

        As Brujah have a lot of good titled vampires among their ranks, this location often finds its place
        amidst them as the cornerstone of their offensive strategy.
        The bonus in both vote and bleed is a definitive edge.

        A decent recursion helper, although getting the cards on the bottom of the library is more useful if
        you
        get to shuffle it at some point.

        A good voter with an excellent ability, his access to <i>o</i> and <i>F</i> are very strong points
