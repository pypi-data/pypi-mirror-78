<h1><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-nosferatu.svg') }}"> Nosferatu</h1>
<p>
    The Nosferatu and their antitribu use the <i>oip</i> disciplines.
    Some good vampires of theirs are used in multi-clan crypts,
    like {{ link("/archetypes/nananimalism", _("Nananimalism")) }} or
    {{ link("/archetypes/the-dark-side-of-politics", _("The Dark Side of Politics")) }}.
    They are seen on their own in only one prominent archetype: the
    {{ link("/archetypes/nosferatu-royalty", _("Nosferatu Royalty")) }}, a toolbox using Camarilla
    <em>Princes</em> and <em>Justicars</em>.

    <p>
        5 pool is a bit pricey for <i>I</i> so she is less seen in mono <i>I</i> or multi-clan decks.
        Her ability can be useful against {{ card("The unnamed") }}
        or
        {{ card("Cybele") }} though.

    <p>
        One pool for permanent stealth is really a bargain: other clans have to pay 2 pool for this kind of
        device.
        Only the Followers of Set <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-followers-of-set.svg') }}">
        have a similar tool with
        {{ card("Opium Den") }}.

        he has an excellent ability that helps get other <em>Princes</em> out faster and cheaper,

    <p>
        His title and bleed bonus, combined with the rare <i>DO</i> discipline combination,
        makes him a good pick in some political decks, like in the
        {{ link("/archetypes/mistress", _("Mistress")) }} archetype.
        His ability can destroy low capacity Anarch decks single-handedly.

        Yet another <em>Prince</em>, she is a bit expensive and does not even have superior <i>I</i>.
        Still, she can find her place in <em>Royalty</em> constructs using <i>O</i>, like in
        {{ link("/archetypes/the-dark-side-of-politics", _("The Dark Side of Politics")) }} archetype.
