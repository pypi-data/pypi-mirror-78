        <i>i</i> Provide a strong long-range combat module and good intercept capabilities.
        Combined with <i>a</i>, it offers the best intercept in the game and access to the combo card
        {{ card("Read the Winds") }}.

        An excellent combat card. It is not a strike so it cannot be dodged,
        it is harder to prevent and additional damage are still inflicted by the strike itself.
        Moreover, it is ranged damage.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 222 decks, typically 2-5 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A versatile defence tool providing either intercept or an unlock effect.
        Not as suprising as a wake, but being unlocked can be better.

        An excellent counter against weapons, it is often included in <i>i</i> combat modules.
        Because <i>i</i> often uses {{ card("Carrion Crows") }}
        and {{ card("Aid from Bats") }} for a ranged combat module,
        a ranged weapon on the opponent side is especially cumbersome.

        The choice between bleed and rush gives it so much versatility,
        it can be played in most table situations at an advantage.
        The fact that the opponent has to choose his strike first is a nice bonus.

        A base building block for most <i>i</i> based intercept modules.
        Permanent intercept is well worth the cost.

        Even if it is only available to big capacity vampires,
        this is intercept and wake built in the same card,
        a no-brainer if the deck has intercept options. It is even arguably better than <i>a</i>
        {{ card("Eyes of Argus") }},
        as the intercept can be used on an undirected action.

        The second pillar of <i>i</i> combat modules, it provides a maneuver, one damage, plus a welcome
        press,
        either as a defensive tool to avoid a second round at close range, or as an offensive tool to
        continue combat. Played multiple times in a row, it can take an opponent down
        pretty fast. Coupled with a {{ card("Carrion Crows") }},
        it delivers 6 damage with only two cards.

        <i>i</i> usually makes for excellent intercept and good combat,
        but it may lack pool damage to fence off oneâ€™s prey,
        with {{ card("Deep Song") }}
        bringing only a bit of pool damage.
        This is an excellent option to improve pool damage
        if the deck has enough intercept capabilities to protect it.
