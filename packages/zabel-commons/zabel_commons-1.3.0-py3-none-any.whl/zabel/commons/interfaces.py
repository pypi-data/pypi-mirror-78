| #Controller               | Defines methods all controllers must
                              implement.                               |
| #Image                    | Defines methods all images must
                              implement.                               |
| #Manager                  | A simple marker for manager classes.     |
| #ManagedProjectDefinition | An abstract class that represents a
                              minimal managed project definition.      |
| #ManagedAccount           | An abstract class that represents a
                              minimal managed account.                 |
| #BaseService              | Defines a handful of methods all
                              services must implement.                 |
| #ManagedService           | Extends #BaseService and is implemented
                              by the abstract classes wrapping each
                              tool.  It defines the methods all managed
                              services must implement (those relative
                              to being an #BaseService and those
                              relative to having members and pushing
                              and pulling projects).                   |
| #Utility                  | Extends #BaseService and is implemented
                              by the shared services (services that are
                              used by multiple platforms or realms)    |
