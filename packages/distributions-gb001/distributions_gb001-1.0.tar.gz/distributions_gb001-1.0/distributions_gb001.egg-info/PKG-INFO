Description: # distributions_gb001
        
        distributions_gb001 is a Python package  for calculating and visualizing a Gaussian distribution and binomial distribution.
        
        ## Description
        
        What you can do with the package:
                for Gaussian distribution and binomial distribution
        
            -   calculate mean and standard deviation.
            -   calculate Probability density function
            -   plot and visualize the normalized histogram of the data and a plot of the 
        		probability density function along the same range or bar probability density function of a binomial distribution
            -   add together two Gaussian or Binomial distributions
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install distributions_gb001.
        
        ```bash
        pip install distributions_gb001
        ```
        
        ## Dependency
        
        - matplotlib (to visualize plotted histogram/bar)
        
        ```bash
        pip install matplotlib
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import distributions_gb001
        
        **- without data file**
        
        gaussian_one = distributions_gb001.Gaussian(22, 3)
        binomial_one = distributions_gb001.Binomial(.9, 20)
        gaussian_one.mean # returns 22
        binomial_one.stdev # returns 1.3416407864998736
        gaussian_one + gaussian_one # returns 'mean 44, standard deviation 4.242640687119285'
        
        **- with data file**
        
        gaussian_two = distributions_gb001.Gaussian()
        gaussian_two.read_data_file("/home/myname/Desktop/numbers.txt")  # read in data from a txt file
        
        gaussian_two.calculate_mean() # calculate mean
        gaussian_two.mean # returns mean value
        
        gaussian_two.calculate_stdev(sample=True)    # calculate standard deviation ...... 
        """note -sample (bool): whether the data represents a sample or population which is set to True as default""" 
        gaussian_two.stdev # returns standard deviation value
        
        gaussian_two.pdf(x) # returns Probability density function output
        """x (float): point for calculating the probability density function"""
        
        gaussian_two.plot_histogram_pdf(n_spaces = 50) # visualize normalized histogram with your set spaces
        """n_spaces (int): number of data points which is set to 50 as default"""
        
        
        
        binomial_two = distributions_gb001.Binomial()
        binomial_two.read_data_file("/home/myname/Desktop/numbers_bin.txt") # read in data from a txt file
        
        binomial_two.calculate_mean() # calculate mean
        binomial_two.mean # returns mean value
        
        binomial_two.calculate_stdev()    # calculate standard deviation ...... 
        binomial_two.stdev # returns standard deviation value
        
        binomial_two.replace_stats_with_data() # to get new mean and standard deviation from the data set
        """ by default --- mean = 10.0
                           standard deviation = 2.23606797749979"""
        binomial_two.mean # returns new mean value
        binomial_two.stdev # returns new standard deviation value
        
        binomial_two.pdf(k) # returns Probability density function output
        """k (integer): point for calculating the probability density function"""
        
        binomial_two.plot_bar_pdf() # visualize normalized histogram with your set spaces
        """n_spaces (int): number of data points which is set to 50 as default"""
        
        
        """"Note : make sure "matplotlib" is installed" to visualize""" 
        """"Note : to provide GUI backend to show figures, make sure python Tkinter is installed - for linux/ubuntu --- sudo apt install python3-tk"""
