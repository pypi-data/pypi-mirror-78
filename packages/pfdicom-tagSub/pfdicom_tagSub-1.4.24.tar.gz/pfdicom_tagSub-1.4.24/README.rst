Quick Overview
--------------

-  ``pfdicom_tagSub`` reads/edits/saves DICOM meta information. It can be used to anonymize DICOM header data.

Overview
--------

``pfdicom_tagSub`` replaces a set of ``<tag, value>`` pairs in a DICOM header with values passed in a JSON structure.

The script accepts an ``<inputDir>``, and then from this point an ``os.walk()`` is performed to extract all the subdirs. Each subdir is examined for DICOM files (in the simplest sense by a file extension mapping) are passed to a processing method that reads and replaces specified DICOM tags, saving the result in a corresponding directory and filename in the output tree.

Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following dependencies are installed on your host system/python3 virtual env (they will also be automatically installed if pulled from pypi):

-  ``pfmisc`` (various misc modules and classes for the pf* family of objects)
-  ``pftree`` (create a dictionary representation of a filesystem hierarchy)
-  ``pfdicom`` (handle underlying DICOM file reading)

Using ``PyPI``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best method of installing this script and all of its dependencies is
by fetching it from PyPI

.. code:: bash

        pip3 install pfdicom_tagSub

Command line arguments
----------------------

.. code:: html


        -I|--inputDir <inputDir>
        Input DICOM directory to examine. By default, the first file in this
        directory is examined for its tag information. There is an implicit
        assumption that each <inputDir> contains a single DICOM series.

        -i|--inputFile <inputFile>
        An optional <inputFile> specified relative to the <inputDir>. If
        specified, then do not perform a directory walk, but convert only
        this file.

        -e|--extension <DICOMextension>
        An optional extension to filter the DICOM files of interest from the
        <inputDir>.

        [-O|--outputDir <outputDir>]
        The output root directory that will contain a tree structure identical
        to the input directory, and each "leaf" node will contain the analysis
        results.

        -F|--tagFile <JSONtagFile>
        Parse the tags and their "subs" from a JSON formatted <JSONtagFile>.

        -T|--tagStruct <JSONtagStructure>
        Parse the tags and their "subs" from a JSON formatted <JSONtagStucture>
        passed directly in the command line.

        -o|--outputFileStem <outputFileStem>
        The output file stem to store data. This should *not* have a file
        extension, or rather, any "." in the name are considered part of
        the stem and are *not* considered extensions.

        [--outputLeafDir <outputLeafDirFormat>]
        If specified, will apply the <outputLeafDirFormat> to the output
        directories containing data. This is useful to blanket describe
        final output directories with some descriptive text, such as
        'anon' or 'preview'.

        This is a formatting spec, so

            --outputLeafDir 'preview-%s'

        where %s is the original leaf directory node, will prefix each
        final directory containing output with the text 'preview-' which
        can be useful in describing some features of the output set.

        [--threads <numThreads>]
        If specified, break the innermost analysis loop into <numThreads>
        threads.

        [-x|--man]
        Show full help.

        [-y|--synopsis]
        Show brief help.

        [--json]
        If specified, output a JSON dump of final return.

        [--followLinks]
        If specified, follow symbolic links.

        -v|--verbosity <level>
        Set the app verbosity level.

            0: No internal output;
            1: Run start / stop output notification;
            2: As with level '1' but with simpleProgress bar in 'pftree';
            3: As with level '2' but with list of input dirs/files in 'pftree';
            5: As with level '3' but with explicit file logging for
                    - read
                    - analyze
                    - write

Examples
--------

Perform a DICOM anonymization by processing specific tags:

.. code:: bash

        pfdicom_tagSub                                      \
            -I /var/www/html/normsmall -e dcm               \
            -O /var/www/html/anon                           \
            --tagStruct '
            {
                "PatientName":              "%_name|patientID_PatientName",
                "PatientID":                "%_md5|7_PatientID",
                "AccessionNumber":          "%_md5|10_AccessionNumber",
                "PatientBirthDate":         "%_strmsk|******01_PatientBirthDate",
                "ReferringPhysicianName":   "ReferringPhysicianName",
                "PhysiciansOfRecord":       "PhysiciansOfRecord",
                "RequestingPhysician":      "RequestingPhysician",
                "InstitutionAddress":       "InstitutionAddress",
                "InstitutionName":          "InstitutionName"
            }
            ' --threads 0 --printElapsedTime

which will output only at script conclusion and will log a JSON formatted string.
