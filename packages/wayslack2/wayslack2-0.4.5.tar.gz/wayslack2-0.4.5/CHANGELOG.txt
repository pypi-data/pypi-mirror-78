0.3.1 (2019-03-06)
    * Computers are hard (didn't fully test etag checking)

0.3.0 (2019-03-06)
    * Fix downloading compressed JPEGs (see "Note 2" in README)
    * Better retrying on rate limit errors

0.2.2 (2017-08-28)
    * Fix a couple crashes when initializing a fresh archive
    * Download emoji

0.2.1 (2017-07-12)
    * Fix bug where messages weren't archived (oops)

0.2.0 (2017-06-24)
    * Explicitly download files to _files (you'll be prompted to update the
      storage format the first time you run wayslack)
    * Add delete_old_files option, which can automatically delete files
      from Slack that are older than a particular age. For example:

	delete_old_files: 60 days

      Will delete files from Slack that are more than 60 days old. This is
      probably only useful for users of the free tier who are limited to
      5gb of storage.

      As you'd hopefully expect, only files which exist in the local wayslack
      archive will be deleted.

0.1.2 (2017-01-04)
    * Add CHANGELOG
    * Move requirements to install_requires
