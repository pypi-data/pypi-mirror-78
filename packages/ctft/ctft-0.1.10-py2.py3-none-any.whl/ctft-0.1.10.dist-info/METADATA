# ctft

ctft is a python cli tool to save and view stylised [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org) writeups locally in your terminal.

- **Search for writeups** by name or keyword
- **View Stylised writeups** from saved files
- Writeups are saved are as **markdown files** which can also be read as plaintext(even though it doesn't make sense to read plaintext over formatted :unamused: )

VSCode users can also use markdown viewing extensions like [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) to view writeups

The project took inspiration from [mzfr's lswriteups](https://github.com/mzfr/lswriteups) but I wanted to further the ease of access and reduce browser dependence.

The tool currently scrapes only writeups on CTFTime.org and github READMEs.
