The `PythonQwt` project was initiated to solve -at least temporarily- the 
obsolescence issue of `PyQwt` (the Python-Qwt C++ bindings library) which is 
no longer maintained. The idea was to translate the original Qwt C++ code to 
Python and then to optimize some parts of the code by writing new modules 
based on NumPy and other libraries.

The `PythonQwt` package consists of a single Python package named `qwt` and 
of a few other files (examples, doc, ...).

See documentation [online](https://pythonqwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [PDF](https://pythonqwt.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/) for more details on 
the library and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for recent history of changes.

## Sample

```python
import qwt
import numpy as np

app = qwt.qt.QtGui.QApplication([])

# Create plot widget
plot = qwt.QwtPlot("Trigonometric functions")
plot.insertLegend(qwt.QwtLegend(), qwt.QwtPlot.BottomLegend)

# Create two curves and attach them to plot
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 500)
qwt.QwtPlotCurve.make(x, np.cos(x), "Cosinus", plot, linecolor="red", antialiased=True)
qwt.QwtPlotCurve.make(x, np.sin(x), "Sinus", plot, linecolor="blue", antialiased=True)

# Resize and show plot
plot.resize(600, 300)
plot.show()

app.exec_()
```

## Examples (tests)

The GUI-based test launcher may be executed from Python:

```python
from qwt import tests
tests.run()
```

or from the command line (script name depends on Python major version number):

```bash
PythonQwt-py3
```

Tests may also be executed in unattended mode:

```bash
PythonQwt-tests-py3 --mode unattended
```

## Overview

The `qwt` package is a pure Python implementation of `Qwt` C++ library with 
the following limitations.

The following `Qwt` classes won't be reimplemented in `qwt` because more
powerful features already exist in `guiqwt`: `QwtPlotZoomer`, 
`QwtCounter`, `QwtEventPattern`, `QwtPicker`, `QwtPlotPicker`.

Only the following plot items are currently implemented in `qwt` (the only 
plot items needed by `guiqwt`): `QwtPlotItem` (base class), `QwtPlotItem`, 
`QwtPlotMarker`, `QwtPlotSeriesItem` and `QwtPlotCurve`.

See "Overview" section in [documentation](https://pythonqwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
for more details on API limitations when comparing to Qwt.

## Dependencies

### Requirements ###
- Python >=2.6 or Python >=3.2
- PyQt4 >=4.4 or PyQt5 >= 5.5 (or PySide2, still experimental, see below)
- QtPy >= 1.3
- NumPy >= 1.5

### Why PySide2 support is still experimental ###

Try running the `curvebenchmark1.py` test with PyQt5 and PySide: you will notice a 
huge performance issue with PySide2 (see screenshot above). This is due to the fact 
that `QPainter.drawPolyline` is much more efficient in PyQt5 than it is in PySide2 
(see [this bug report](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/PYSIDE/issues/PYSIDE-1366)).

As a consequence, until this bug is fixed in PySide2, we still recommend using PyQt5 
instead of PySide2 when it comes to representing huge data sets.

However, PySide2 support was significatively improved betwen PythonQwt V0.8.0 and 
V0.8.1 thanks to the new `array2d_to_qpolygonf` function (see the part related to 
PySide2 in the code below).

```python
def array2d_to_qpolygonf(xdata, ydata):
    """
    Utility function to convert two 1D-NumPy arrays representing curve data 
    (X-axis, Y-axis data) into a single polyline (QtGui.PolygonF object). 
    This feature is compatible with PyQt4, PyQt5 and PySide2 (requires QtPy).

    :param numpy.ndarray xdata: 1D-NumPy array (numpy.float64)
    :param numpy.ndarray ydata: 1D-NumPy array (numpy.float64)
    :return: Polyline
    :rtype: QtGui.QPolygonF
    """
    dtype = np.float
    if not (
        xdata.size == ydata.size == xdata.shape[0] == ydata.shape[0]
        and xdata.dtype == ydata.dtype == dtype
    ):
        raise ValueError("Arguments must be 1D, float64 NumPy arrays with same size")
    size = xdata.size
    polyline = QPolygonF(size)
    if PYSIDE2:  # PySide2 (obviously...)
        address = shiboken2.getCppPointer(polyline.data())[0]
        buffer = (ctypes.c_double * 2 * size).from_address(address)
    else:  # PyQt4, PyQt5
        buffer = polyline.data()
        buffer.setsize(2 * size * np.finfo(dtype).dtype.itemsize)
    memory = np.frombuffer(buffer, dtype)
    memory[: (size - 1) * 2 + 1 : 2] = xdata
    memory[1 : (size - 1) * 2 + 2 : 2] = ydata
    return polyline
```
