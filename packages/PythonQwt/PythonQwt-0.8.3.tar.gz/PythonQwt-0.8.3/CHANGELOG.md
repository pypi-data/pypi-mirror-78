# PythonQwt Releases #

### Version 0.8.3 ###

- Fixed simple plot examples (setup.py & plot.py's doc page) following the introduction 
  of the new QtPy dependency (Qt compatibility layer) since V0.8.0.

### Version 0.8.2 ###

- Added new GUI-based test script `PythonQwt-py3` to run the test launcher.
- Added command-line options to the `PythonQwt-tests-py3` script to run all the tests 
  simultenously in unattended mode (`--mode unattended`) or to update all the 
  screenshots (`--mode screenshots`).
- Added internal scripts for automated test in virtual environments with both PyQt5 and 
  PySide2.

### Version 0.8.1 ###

- PySide2 support was significatively improved betwen PythonQwt V0.8.0 and 
  V0.8.1 thanks to the new `qwt.qwt_curve.array2d_to_qpolygonf` function.

### Version 0.8.0 ###

- Added PySide2 support: PythonQwt is now compatible with Python 2.7, Python 3.4+, 
  PyQt4, PyQt5 and PySide2!
  
### Version 0.7.1 ###

- Changed QwtPlotItem.detachItems signature: removed unnecessary "autoDelete" argument, 
  initialiazing "rtti" argument to None (remove all items)
- Improved Qt universal support (PyQt5, ...)

### Version 0.7.0 ###

- Added convenience functions for creating usual objects (curve, grid, marker, ...):

    - `QwtPlotCurve.make`
    - `QwtPlotMarker.make`
    - `QwtPlotGrid.make`
    - `QwtSymbol.make`
    - `QwtText.make`

- Added new test launcher with screenshots (automatically generated)
- Removed `guidata` dependency thanks to the new specific GUI-based test launcher
- Updated documentation (added more examples, using automatically generated screenshots)
- QwtPlot: added "flatStyle" option, a PythonQwt-exclusive feature improving 
  default plot style (without margin, more compact and flat look) -- option is 
  enabled by default
- QwtAbstractScaleDraw: added option to set the tick color lighter factor for 
  each tick type (minor, medium, major) -- this feature is used with the new 
  flatStyle option
- Fixed obvious errors (+ poor implementations) in untested code parts
- Major code cleaning and formatting


### Version 0.6.2 ###

- Fixed Python crash occuring at exit when deleting objects (Python 3 only)
- Moved documentation to https://docs.readthedocs.io/
- Added unattended tests with multiple versions of WinPython:
    
    - WinPython-32bit-2.7.6.4
    - WinPython-64bit-2.7.6.4
    - WinPython-64bit-3.4.4.3
    - WinPython-64bit-3.4.4.3Qt5
    - WPy64-3680
    - WPy64-3771
    - WPy64-3830

- Added PyQt4/PyQt5/PySide automatic switch depending on installed libraries


### Version 0.6.1 ###

- Fixed rounding issue with PythonQwt scale engine (0...1000 is now divided 
  in 200-size steps, as in both Qwt and PyQwt)
- Removed unnecessary mask on scaleWidget (this closes #35)
- CurveBenchmark.py: fixed TypeError with numpy.linspace (NumPy=1.18)


### Version 0.6.0 ###

- Ported changes from Qwt 6.1.2 to Qwt 6.1.5
- `QwtPlotCanvas.setPaintAttribute`: fixed PyQt4 compatibility issue for BackingStore paint attribute
- Fixed DataDemo.py test script (was crashing ; this closes #41)
- `QwtPainterClass.drawBackground`: fixed obvious bug in untested code (this closes #51)
- `qwtFillBackground`: fixed obvious bug in untested code (this closes #50)
- `QwtPainterClass.fillPixmap`: fixed obvious bug in untested code (this closes #49)
- `QwtStyleSheetRecorder`: fixed obvious bug in untested code (this closes #47, closes #48 and closes #52)
- Added "plot without margins" test for Issue #35


### Version 0.5.5 ###

- `QwtScaleMap.invTransform_scalar`: avoid divide by 0
- Avoid error when computing ticks: when the axis was so small that no tick could be drawn, an exception used to be raised


### Version 0.5.4 ###

Fixed an annoying bug which caused scale widget (axis ticks in particular) 
to be misaligned with canvas grid: the user was forced to resize the plot 
widget as a workaround


### Version 0.5.3 ###

- Better handling of infinity and `NaN` values in scales (removed `NumPy` 
warnings)
- Now handling infinity and `NaN` values in series data: removing points that 
can't be drawn
- Fixed logarithmic scale engine: presence of values <= 0 was slowing down 
series data plotting


### Version 0.5.2 ###

- Added CHM documentation to wheel package
- Fixed `QwtPlotRenderer.setDiscardFlag`/`setLayoutFlag` args
- Fixed `QwtPlotItem.setItemInterest` args
- Fixed `QwtPlot.setAxisAutoScale`/`setAutoReplot` args


### Version 0.5.1 ###

- Fixed Issue #22: fixed scale issues in [CurveDemo2.py](qwt/tests/CurveDemo2.py) 
and [ImagePlotDemo.py](qwt/tests/ImagePlotDemo.py)
- `QwtPlotCurve`: sticks were not drawn correctly depending on orientation
- `QwtInterval`: avoid overflows with `NumPy` scalars
- Fixed Issue #28: curve shading was broken since v0.5.0
- setup.py: using setuptools "entry_points" instead of distutils "scripts"
- Showing curves/plots number in benchmarks to avoid any misinterpretation 
(see Issue #26)
- Added Python2/Python3 scripts for running tests


### Version 0.5.0 ###

- Various optimizations
- Major API simplification, taking into account the feature that won't be 
implemented (fitting, rounding, weeding out points, clipping, etc.)
- Added `QwtScaleDraw.setLabelAutoSize`/`labelAutoSize` methods to set the new 
auto size option (see [documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/PythonQwt/))


### Version 0.4.0 ###

- Color bar: fixed axis ticks shaking when color bar is enabled
- Fixed `QwtPainter.drawColorBar` for horizontal color bars (typo)
- Restored compatibility with original Qwt signals (`QwtPlot`, ...)


### Version 0.3.0 ###

Renamed the project (python-qwt --> PythonQwt), for various reasons.


### Version 0.2.1 ###

Fixed Issue #23: "argument numPoints is not implemented" error was showing 
up when calling `QwtSymbol.drawSymbol(symbol, QPoint(x, y))`.


### Version 0.2.0 ###

Added docstrings in all Python modules and a complete documentation based on 
Sphinx. See the Overview section for API limitations when comparing to Qwt.


### Version 0.1.1 ###

Fixed Issue #21 (blocking issue *only* on non-Windows platforms when 
building the package): typo in "PythonQwt-tests" script name 
(in [setup script](setup.py))


### Version 0.1.0 ###

First alpha public release.
