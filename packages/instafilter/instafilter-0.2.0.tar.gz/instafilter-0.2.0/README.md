Quickly modifiy images using Instagram-like filters with deep learning in python. Install with:

    pip install instafilter

Example:

``` python
from instafilter import Instafilter

model = Instafilter("Lo-fi")
new_image = model("myimage.jpg")

# To save the image, use cv2
import cv2
cv2.imwrite("modified_image.jpg", new_image)
```
